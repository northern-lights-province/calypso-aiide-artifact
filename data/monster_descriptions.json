    "long": "Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire.\n\nAboleths have never forgotten.\n\n_**Eternal Memories**_. Aboleths have flawless memories. They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds.\n\nAboleths' minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth's plan.\n\n_**Gods in the Lake.**_ Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories.\n\nAboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.\n\n_**Enemies of the Gods.**_ The aboleths' fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth's body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of Water, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months.\n\nUltimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution.",

    "lair": "Aboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally to treat with visitors or worshipers.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nWhen fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The aboleth casts phantasmal force (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can't take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth's phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.\n- Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.\n- Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature's rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.\n- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.\n- As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.\n\nIf the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d10 days."

    "long": "The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.\n\nWith deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.\n\nWhen it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.\n\n_**Brutal and Cruel.**_ All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.\n\nA black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.\n\n_**Foes and Servants.**_ Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.\n\nEvil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.\n\nA black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.\n\nKobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.",

Mindless Undead, shambling mounds, carnivorous flora, Oozes, and Constructs make appealing servants, especially working in concert with a black dragon's fiendishly clever traps.

The threatened nation is recruiting adventurers to defend it.\n```\n\n**Black Dragon Lairs**\n\nBlack dragons prefer to lair in swamps and jungles--the more dismal and fetid, the better. Within those environs, they favor ruins for their defensibility and dreary aesthetic.\n\nWhen choosing their lairs, black dragons are fond of locations that are naturally constraining and confounding. Whether adventurers seeking the dragon must wind their way through the roots of an ancient mangrove swamp or brave a trap-filled boggy ruin, the experience promises to be a deadly affair.\n\n**Black Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe black dragon lair shown in [map 5.2](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map52blackdragonlair \"map 5.2\") is a derelict chapel, lost to time in a gloomy fen. The building's wooden framing rotted away long ago, leaving a looming skeleton of lichen-covered stone and a lone tower. The lair has the following features:\n\n**Swampy Lake.** Abutting the chapel is a swampy lake where the dragon sleeps. The foul water stinks of dead fish and rot, while the dense foliage and scraggly trees along the shoreline writhe with scuttling, slithering fauna. A thick blanket of fog--part of the dragon's corrupting influence--adds a claustrophobic feel to the lair.\n\n**Chapel Floor.** Columns of clammy stone jut like ribs from the chapel's exposed floor, as if in mockery of the sanctity of this once-holy place.\n\n**Underground.** Twin staircases in the main hall descend to a partially flooded crypt. Five trapped stone sarcophagi rise above the waterline, their lids depicting armored warriors whose faces have been scoured away by acid. Each sarcophagus holds a few coins and shiny baubles mixed with junk that appears to be treasure at first glance. In the tower basement, a fully submerged tunnel leads to the lake where the dragon sleeps.\n\n**Chapel Tower.** A swollen oak door, flanked by worn carvings of noble warriors, opens into the dank stone tower, which stands empty except for a chipped staircase that climbs to a second floor and then ends in midair before reaching the crumbling third level. Mold-covered friezes of knights kneeling before angelic beings line the stairwell.\n\n**Tower Top.** The dragon's true hoard is kept safely at the top of the crumbling tower, where the dragon enjoys perching and staring out into the gloom. Intruders who can't fly must scale the sheer, slimy walls of the tower (either from outside or from the interior of the second floor), braving whatever traps might be in store if they hope to claim the dragon's real treasures.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) black dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Filth Burst.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is difficult terrain.\n\n**Grasping Muck.** Tendrils of roiling muck extend from the dragon's lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon's choice that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Noxious Gas.** A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a black dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Ennui.** Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair are filled with listless despair.\n\n**Grating Spies.** Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6 miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The dragon can suppress this effect at will.\n\n**Rotting Domain.** Stinging bugs are aggressive and the air is heavy with the odor of rot within 6 miles of the lair.",
    "lair": "Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.\n- A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.\n- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.\n- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.\n- Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.\n\nIf the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days."

    "long": "Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.\n\nA blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.\n\nA blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.\n\n_**Vain and Deadly.**_ A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.\n\nA blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.\n\n_**Desert Predators.**_ Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.\n\nWhen it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.\n\n_**Overlords and Minions.**_ Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.\n\nA blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.\n\n_**Hoarders of Gems.**_ Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.\n\nA blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.",

Though territorial, they are willing to allow creatures they consider their servants to live peacefully within their domains. Blue dragons are also more family oriented than many other dragons, and it's not unusual to find a multigenerational extended family of blue dragons sharing a territory. Other creatures need to tread carefully in such a place, for any injury or insult to one of the dragons is considered a strike against the whole family.\n\n**Adult Blue Dragon Connections**\n\n```\n|   d8 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | An adult blue dragon rules a city and applies exacting standards of aesthetic perfection to everything and everyone in it, swiftly disposing of anyone who fails to meet those standards.\n|    2 | An adult blue dragon and an efreeti have formed a friendship over the decades.

They prefer warm climates, but if an otherwise ideal potential lair presents itself in a cold environment, they find ways to adapt. Instead of seeking out lofty domiciles, blue dragons build their lairs underground, burrowing beneath sand or using magic to hew rock into an intricate warren of rooms and tunnels that can be expanded to accommodate a growing family. Still, they appreciate the tactical advantages of height and usually create their lairs near a spire or cliff from which they can keep watch over their territory.\n\nThough most blue dragons would be loath to the use the term themselves, their lairs are often surprisingly homey. They favor lairs that balance beauty and comfort and adorn them in soothing shades of blue, purple, and green.\n\n**Blue Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe blue dragon lair shown in [map 5.3](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map53bluedragonlair \"map 5.3\") is built in the ruins of an ancient city swallowed by desert sands. Some of the lair's chambers still contain the remnants of temples and other structures. The traces of this metropolis suggest that it was of significant size, but very little of it remains accessible in the area of the lair, since the dragon has collapsed the lair on intruders multiple times, rebuilding in a nearby portion of the ruins each time.\n\nThe walls of the lair are crystallized glass formed by the dragon's lightning breath. Most of its floors are loosely packed sand, with patches of rough stone showing through in some areas. The dragon has constructed a system of mirrors to bring in sunlight from chambers open to the sky, a system that not only brightly lights the interior but also heats the sand to a comfortable basking temperature.\n\nThe lair has the following features:\n\n**Entrance Chamber.** An open central cavern is the lair's primary entrance. The glass walls rise 30 feet to the surface and are fused with carved stone pillars and partial walls from the ancient city. A narrow, jagged piece of granite juts out horizontally from the wall near the top of the chamber, providing a perch from which the dragon can survey the cavern. The sand covering the floor of the chamber sometimes ripples or swirls ominously, perhaps in response to unpredictable desert winds, the dragon's magic, or some creature lurking beneath the sand.\n\n**Hoard Display.** Just off the entrance chamber (toward the left side of the map), a smaller cavern with a worked stone floor contains the dragon's artfully arranged hoard. The glass walls of this chamber are studded with blue gems, and narrow light wells let in sunlight that bathes the room in dappled blue light. The ancient stone tiles on the floor contain lightning-charged traps to blast intruders.\n\n**Dragon's Den.** The dragon sleeps in a large chamber in the bottom right of the map. The den is a well-preserved remnant of the ancient city; this gracious, elegant space is hung with silk curtains in shades of blue and purple, and its worked-stone floor is covered with plush, patterned rugs in complementary hues. It features a bejeweled and cushioned dais on which the dragon often reclines.\n\n**Private Entrance.** Just above and to the right of the den is a small chamber open to the sky that the dragon uses as a private entrance to the lair. A secret door prevents unwitting creatures from wandering directly into the den.\n\n**Treasury.** At the left end of the den, a door set under a blue-tiled arch leads to a smaller room where the dragon keeps relics that are too precious for the main hoard or that don't match the hoard's overall aesthetic.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) blue dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Misleading Mirage.** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.\n\n**Sudden Sinkhole.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the pit.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Blue Luster.** Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.\n\n**Mirage Terrain.** The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.\n\n**Sandstorm.** A sandstorm blows constantly within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.",
    "lair": "Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.\n\nThunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense.\n\nA blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions -- along with the wealth of the dead intruders.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.\n- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n- Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.\n- Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (\u22125).\n- Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6\u00d7 10 feet into the sinkhole.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are."

    "long": "The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.\n\nA brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.\n\n_**Boldly Talkative.**_ A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.\n\nA brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.\n\n_**Prized Treasures.**_ Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.\n\nBrass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.",

Brass dragons often compete with blue dragons for lair sites, but are more likely to make a lair among rocks than to burrow under the sands.\n\nBrass dragons like their lairs to be spacious and well lit; many lairs feature windows or skylights to let sunlight in. They respect skillfully wrought stonework and often take over canyon fortresses and similar structures when they're abandoned by their original non-dragon builders. Brass dragons are also capable of fine stonework themselves, and many meticulously carve out grand halls and galleries in which to store and display their hoards.\n\n**Brass Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe brass dragon lair shown in [map 5.4](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map54brassdragonlair \"map 5.4\") is an ancient ruin located within rough, stony canyons in a desert environment. The lair has the following features:\n\n**Column Guardians.** Massive columns carved to resemble warriors watch over the main entrance to the canyons; the dragon has given them whimsical names and ascribed unique personalities to them.\n\n**Grand Hall.** At the deepest part of the canyon, a wide archway admits visitors to the grand hall that serves as the main lair. Regal statues stand bathed in sunlight admitted by huge shafts in the ceiling--wide enough for the dragon to climb up but not fly through. A much larger shaft above the rear chamber allows the dragon to fly directly in and out of the lair.\n\n**Hoard Chamber.** The bulk of the dragon's hoard is stored in a partially collapsed chamber most easily accessed by way of a shaft in the ceiling. (A narrow gap in the fallen stones filling an old passageway might allow a Small or nimble character to squeeze in or out that way.) Eight heavy pillars surround a well in the floor and support the ceiling around the shaft.\n\n**Unused Chamber.** A smaller chamber shown on the left side of the map is not currently used by the dragon, but it shows signs of having been recently used by visitors--either creatures welcomed by the dragon or ones that escaped the dragon's notice.\n\n**Wells.** Four wells--three in the canyons leading to the main hall and one inside the hoard chamber--provide fresh water for the dragon and any guests, and they also serve as a sort of alarm system. As described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_ , whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of one of these wells, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) brass dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Animate Statues.** The dragon chooses up to three statues in the lair that it can see. Each of these statues briefly animates and attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +7 bonus to hit and dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit.\n\n**Blast of Wind.** A mighty wind sweeps through the lair in a direction of the dragon's choice, blowing along a line 40 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature in that area except the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the wind's direction and be knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. If the dragon is within the area of the wind, it can choose to be pushed 15 feet in the wind's direction, and the wind can't knock the dragon prone.\n\n**Obscuring Sand.** Dust and sand fill the air within 120 feet of the dragon, making the area lightly obscured until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a brass dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Cloud Companion.** A small, wispy cloud follows non-evil creatures as they journey within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. It changes direction as the creatures do, remaining interposed between them and the direct glare of the sun, and grants them advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of [extreme heat](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeHeat \"extreme heat\") (see the _[Dungeon Master's Guide](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg \"Dungeon Master's Guide\")_).\n\n**Talkative Denizens.** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find pleasure in hearing the sound of their own voices. The air is filled with a deafening chorus of birds and small animals, and sapient creatures talk extensively.",
    "lair": "**A Brass Dragon's Lair**\n\nA brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.\n- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.\n- Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.\n- Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately."

They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.\n\nA ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.\n\n_**Dragons of the Coast.**_ Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.\n\n_**War Machines.**_ Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.\n\nWhen a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.\n\n_**Well-Organized Wealth.**_ Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment.

Some make dry homes atop lonely sea stacks, while others favor completely submerged lairs in sunken ruins. Many seek out strongholds straddling land and sea, with both dry and flooded chambers.\n\nWhen it comes to lairs, bronze dragons value function over form, and they study potential sites with a military commander's eye for defense. They appreciate the solidity of cliff-side caves or stone fortresses, often reinforcing existing defenses with clever traps and bulwarks. At the same time, bronze dragons understand that they are their own best defense in a siege, so they are careful to maximize their mobility with multiple ways in and out of their lairs.\n\n**Bronze Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe bronze dragon lair shown on [map 5.5](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map55bronzedragonlair \"map 5.5\") is a set of sea caves that once served as a dwarven military outpost. The lair has the following features:\n\n**Sentinel Statue.** In a hidden cove sheltered from the sea, a statue of a dour elf queen watches over a small beach. The statue's eyes are magically warded to alert the dragon of intruders.\n\n**Campaign Chamber.** Beyond the beach stands a pillared dwarven hall whose walls have begun to crumble near the entrances. Here the dragon grants audiences and presides over councils of war, surrounded by trophies chosen to remind viewers of the dragon's heroic history.\n\n**Lofty Alcove.** Up a steep set of stairs at the bottom right of the map lies a dry chamber that serves as barracks for guests and a library for documents too fragile to survive in damp conditions.\n\n**Island Larder.** Another elevated chamber carved into the cliffs of a small island abutting the beach (in the center right of the map) serves as a larder in case of a siege. It also houses a clever series of mirrors arranged throughout the stone to allow the dragon to observe the seascape unnoticed.\n\n**Watery Caves.** Two chambers near the top of the map are accessible only via submerged tunnels, their entrances disguised with thick seaweed and boulders. The larger cavern on the right is the dragon's sleeping chamber, while the smaller on the left holds most of the dragon's hoard.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) bronze dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Ocean's Call.** The dragon conjures a swarm of spectral dolphins. Each creature in the water within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d6) slashing damage; then the swarm vanishes.\n\n**Salt Burst.** The dragon chooses a point it can see in the lair. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point bursts with abrasive salt crystals. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) slashing damage.\n\n**Whelming Water.** The dragon causes a strong current to course through the water in its lair. The dragon chooses any number of creatures it can see that are standing or swimming in water within 120 feet of it. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a bronze dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Phantom Escort.** Ghostly naval ships from an ancient armada appear, escorting well-meaning creatures in need of the dragon's help toward the dragon's lair.\n\n**Underwater Pursuit.** Sailors glimpse the shadowy, illusory form of a dragon in the depths below them, keeping pace with their vessel.\n\n**Unfailing Faithfulness.** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair find it nearly impossible to break a promise.",

It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n- A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it.

The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.\n- Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.\n- Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.\n\nIf the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days."

    "long": "Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.\n\nA copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.\n\n_**Good Hosts.**_ A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.\n\nCopper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.\n\n_**Cautious and Crafty.**_ When building its hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.\n\nA copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.",

Although sometimes natural, the passages and caverns of a copper dragon's lair might be carved out or expanded by the dragon's powerful acid breath.\n\nCopper dragon burrows are often sinuous and winding, featuring twists, turns, and dead ends. Blank walls in the lair can conceal cunning hidden passages or might be stone or clay thin enough for the dragon to burst through them. The narrowest tunnels in a copper dragon's lair are just barely wide enough to accommodate the dragon's body, and they typically loop around and reconnect with themselves so the dragon can double back without having to reverse direction.\n\n**Copper Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe copper dragon lair shown in [map 5.6](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map56copperdragonlair \"map 5.6\") is a network of tunnels and large chambers dug beneath dry, rocky hills. The dragon's acid breath has left the surface of the stone here with a smooth, melted appearance.\n\nThe lair has the following features:\n\n**Concealed Entrances.** Four sloping tunnels emerge onto the surface among the hills, concealed by brush and tumbled stone. These openings allow the dragon to enter and depart the lair via multiple routes. Additionally, the sunken areas shown on the surface map correspond to areas where the dragon can burst through the ceiling to reach the surface.\n\n**Secret Doors.** Concealed passages connect a number of the tunnels and chambers of the lair. Their secret doors are magical in nature, with the stone at a passage junction reshaping itself at the dragon's command to open a passage or close it again (similar to the effect of a stone shape spell). Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 10 feet of one of these secret doors, the dragon becomes aware of that creature's presence and location. Each secret door radiates an aura of transmutation magic but is otherwise indistinguishable from solid stone.\n\n**Hoard Chamber.** At the bottom of the underground map, a chamber hidden beyond two secret passages and carved out beneath a low hill contains the bulk of the dragon's hoard. The dragon often sleeps in the adjoining chamber, acting as a final line of defense against intruders.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) copper dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Laughing Gas.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A cloud of pink gas fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area that fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is incapacitated with laughter until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Torpid Energy.** The dragon chooses a creature it can see within 120 feet of it. If the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, its speed is halved, and it can't use reactions or bonus actions until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nEither of these effects might appear in the area around a copper dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Distant Melodies.** The ethereal music of woodwinds and bells can be heard carried on the wind within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.\n\n**Starlit Stones.** Standing stones are common on hilltops within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The stones shed dim light in a 10-foot radius at night. (If the dragon dies, the stones remain, but they no longer shed light.)",
    "lair": "**A Copper Dragon's Lair**\n\nCopper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n- The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.\n- Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts.\n- Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately."

    "long": "The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.\n\nA gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.\n\n_**Devourer of Wealth.**_ Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.\n\n_**Reserved Shapeshifters.**_ Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.\n\nOlder gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or weeks on end.\n\n_**Master Hoarders.**_ A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.",

Many live in the ruins of vanished cultures, appreciating the beautiful inevitability of entropy and the reminder of how easily progress can be lost without careful tending. Crumbling shrines, towers reclaimed by the wilderness, and fallen fortresses all appeal to a gold dragon's sense of history--though they can be equally enraptured by picturesque natural settings. A gold dragon lair almost always involves water, be it a river, a lake, or an ocean shore.\n\n**Gold Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe gold dragon lair shown in [map 5.9](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map59golddragonlair \"map 5.9\") occupies a misty river gorge and has the following features:\n\n**Waterfall Cave.** A rushing river cascades over the cliff in a scintillating waterfall, concealing the entrance to the dragon's cavern complex. Past this thundering curtain, a cave opens into the grand hall.\n\n**Grand Hall.** Six glowing crystalline columns support the ceiling of this cave. The columns' colors reflect the dragon's mood, and they can animate to defend the lair.\n\n**Gallery.** A passageway running left from the grand hall is lined with busts of allies and enemies from the dragon's past. This area contains the _water mirror_, a magical glass case filled by seepage from the river above, which the dragon uses to scry across both distance and time.\n\n**Sleeping Chamber.** At the end of the gallery passage, the dragon's sleeping chamber opens up, its walls lined with shelves holding books and useful magic items.\n\n**Treasury Hall.** Armored doors within the sleeping chamber lead to the dragon's treasury hall, which features an 80-foot sheer drop into a viewing gallery.\n\n**Hoard and Vault.** A chamber on the right side of the treasury hall holds the dragon's hoard, which serves to distract would-be thieves from a store of dangerous and corrupting artifacts hidden in a secret vault opposite the hoard chamber.\n\n**Pantry.** A rough chamber off the right side of the great hall acts as the dragon's pantry, holding racks of pearls and other gems.\n\n**Apartments.** In the top right corner of the map, a worked-stone alcove leads to Humanoid-scale apartments to accommodate the dragon's most honored comrades, as well as the dragon in Humanoid form.\n\n**Pavilions.** Outside the lair, weathered pavilions climb the cliffs overlooking the waterfall's plunge pool, offering a convenient place for the dragon to meet visitors. Beyond the pavilions, an elegant pathway winds through self-manicuring gardens before ending abruptly in trackless wilderness.\n\n**Additional Lair Action**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) gold dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:\n\n**Beguiling Glow.** Warm light fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon; each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a gold dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Beneficent Trail.** Within 10 miles of the dragon's lair, small runes in the shape of a gold dragon appear to creatures in great need, marking a subtle trail leading to the dragon's lair.\n\n**Emanation of Justice.** Creatures that spend a year within 6 miles of the dragon's lair value fairness and justice over their personal feelings.\n\n**Liar's Revelation.** Within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, any creature attempting to tell a deliberate lie must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or find itself accidentally revealing the truth it was attempting to conceal. The first time a creature fails this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.",
    "lair": "**A Gold Dragon's Lair**\n\nGold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n- One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.\n- Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil creatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.\n- Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.\n\nIf the dragon dies, these effects end immediately."

A green dragon is recognized by the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull.",
    "long": "The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.\n\nA green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.\n\nA wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.\n\nA green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.\n\n_**Capricious Hunters.**_ A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.\n\nGreen dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.\n\nA green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.\n\n_**Manipulative Schemers.**_ A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.\n\nWhen manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.\n\n_**Conflict and Corruption.**_ Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch -- sometimes for decades -- for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.\n\nGreen dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.\n\n_**Living Treasures.**_ A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards.

An older green dragon might indulge in horticulture, cultivating the local flora as befits their individual aesthetic. However, most green dragons are content to either excavate beneath trees and nestle among the roots or make lairs inside trees large enough to be hollowed out without compromising their structure.\n\nGreen dragons take great interest in woodland settlements when seeking lair sites. Though they are fully capable of modifying forests to their own liking, they find it easier and vastly more entertaining to take something belonging to smaller and weaker beings.\n\n**Green Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe green dragon lair shown in [map 5.10](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map510greendragonlair \"map 5.10\") was an enormous banyan tree once sacred to the wood elves who lived around it. The original host tree around which the banyan tree grew is now dead and has rotted away, leaving a large columnar shaft within the trunk of the banyan that the dragon has expanded into a subterranean lair. The banyan continues to grow and to swallow up other nearby trees.\n\nThe lair has the following features:\n\n**Canopy.** The green dragon has teased the banyan's sprawling canopy into a bowl-like shape within which the dragon can comfortably lounge. Threaded through the branches are bones from the dragon's meals--some messily clustered among the leaves, and others deliberately arranged to create macabre dioramas for the dragon's amusement. Such grisly scenes can also be seen scattered throughout the lair as reminders of the dragon's power, and as distractions and warnings for would-be interlopers.\n\n**Underground.** The hollow center of the tree gives access to the dragon's lair below, nestled among the banyan's sprawling roots. Three tunnels branch off from the vertical shaft at different levels--none of them at the very bottom. This means a creature that falls to the bottom must find a way to ascend at least as far as the lowest tunnel.\n\n**Hoard Chamber.** All three passages eventually converge in the large chamber at the right side of the map, where most of the dragon's hoard is kept.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Creeper Vines.** The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become zombies (see their entry in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_). The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.\n\n**Lashing Root.** One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nEither or both of these effects might appear in the area around a green dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of those described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Inviting Whispers.** Whispers rustle in the foliage within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.\n\n**Twisted Messengers.** The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature's throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon's own in order to allow the dragon's voice to issue forth.",
    "lair": "The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.\n\nAt the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n- A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n- Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.\nEach 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.\n- Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.\n- Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns."

    "long": "The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.\n\nThe odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.\n\nThe scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.\n\n_**Mountain Masters.**_ Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.\n\n_**Arrogant Tyrants.**_ Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.\n\nNo other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.\n\n_**Status and Servants.**_ Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.\n\nWhen it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.\n\n_**Obsessive Collectors.**_ Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.\n\nA red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.",

Lairs with natural geothermal or lava vents are highly sought after, as these features create an environment ideally suited to the dragons' taste.\n\nMinions often attend red dragons in their lairs. These servants keep the place swept clean of refuse and watch out for intruders, while providing the imperious dragon with subjects to bully and command. Some minions worship the dragon and serve willingly, but others would escape if they could.\n\n**Red Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe red dragon lair shown in [map 5.11](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map511reddragonlair) is inside the caldera of an active volcano. Azers dug out and expanded the lava tunnels within the volcano's peak, just above the level of the caldera's lava pools. Although the azers are long since gone, their construction--and much of their lost wealth--now serves the dragon's needs. That construction also provides a network of tunnels too small for the dragon to use, but where other creatures can make their lairs.\n\nThe lair has the following features:\n\n**Caldera.** The steep sides of the caldera drop away from the edge of the cone, making a 60-foot descent to the lava below. The rough rock of the caldera is not overly difficult to climb, but the area grows increasingly hot as creatures descend.\n\n**Pillared Hall.** The dragon sleeps in the large hall on the left edge of the map, where a row of crumbling pillars supports the ceiling and a narrow channel of lava keeps the hall hot.\n\n**Hoard.** A side tunnel off the pillared hall descends 30 feet down a steep lava tube to a ledge above a pool of magma. Here the dragon has piled a hoard that gleams in the dull red light.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) red dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Noxious Smoke.** A cloud of thick, dark smoke fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature other than the dragon that starts its turn in the cloud or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. The cloud lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Searing Heat.** Searing heat spreads out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature that enters the affected area or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The heat lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a red dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm)_:\n\n**Desertification.** Precipitation is almost nonexistent within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, making the land parched and arid and most plant life withered and brown.\n\n**Fiery Senses.** The dragon can hear up to 30 feet through any open flame within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.\n\n**Ominous Flames.** Open flames within 6 miles of the dragon's lair are tinged dark red, hiss and crackle constantly, and throw off embers and showers of sparks.",
    "lair": "**A Red Dragon's Lair**\n\nRed dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.\n\nWith its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls--and the wider world it seeks to control.\n\nThroughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n- A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.\n- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.\n- Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.\n\nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days."

    "long": "The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.\n\nA silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.\n\n_**Dragons of Virtue.**_ Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.\n\n_**Friends of the Small Races.**_ Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.\n\nSilver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.\n\n_**Respect for Humanity.**_ Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.\n\n_**Hoarding History.**_ Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.",

Often, this has less to do with concerns such as security and privacy, and more to do with meeting or exceeding expectations. If humans, elves, and dwarves expect dragons to be found in such lofty environs, that's what they'll get.\n\nThis inclination toward using high-altitude locales as sites for lairs isn't without complications, though. Silver dragons often end up in competition with other dragons, notably red dragons, for control of such places. And even after establishing their lairs, silver dragons often need to fight to protect their dominion.\n\nThe lair of a silver dragon is always an impressive sight. Young dragons make their homes in icy cliffs, excavating space for themselves within the mountainside. Older silver dragons sometimes decorate their cliff-side habitats with ruins carefully collected from other places in the world. Depending on the dragon, a lair can be a multi-tiered affair, with its highest levels extending fully into the sky.\n\n**Silver Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe silver dragon lair shown in [map 5.13](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map513silverdragonlair \"map 5.13\") is composed of three connected sections--an antechamber, an open court, and a majestic temple. The lair has the following features:\n\n**Antechamber.** The antechamber was once an ancient throne room or mountain shrine, but time has eroded any clues as to its original builders. Its walls are hung with velvet tapestries featuring heroic figures performing a variety of glorious acts.\n\n**Side Chambers.** A few small private side chambers allow the dragon (usually in Humanoid guise) to meet with visitors.\n\n**Cloud Bridge.** From the antechamber, visitors travel upward along a path of clouds. The impressive route is not as dangerous as its lack of railings and the literal airiness of each footstep might suggest.\n\n**Open Court.** Past the cloud bridge is an enormous expanse of smooth stone ringed with broken pillars, where the silver dragon hosts visitors in grand style. Though this court is often surrounded by clouds, the dragon can clear them away with a moment's thought, revealing a breathtaking view of the surrounding region.\n\n**Majestic Temple.** The final section of the lair is a grand domed temple set with a plethora of comfortable furnishings. Here and there, souvenirs from the silver dragon's long life are positioned with great care.\n\n**Under Temple.** A broad shaft in the temple opens into a treasury chamber below, where the dragon's hoard is arranged in gleaming splendor.\n\n**Additional Lair Action**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) silver dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:\n\n**Icy Grip.** A sudden, supernatural chill fills the lair near the dragon. Each creature of the dragon's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures that have resistance to cold damage have advantage on the saving throw; creatures that have immunity to cold damage succeed automatically.",
    "lair": "**A Silver Dragon's Lair**\n\nSilver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n- A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.\n\n- Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.\n- Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon's or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.\n- Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.\n\nIf the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days."

    "long": "The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.\n\nA white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.\n\n_**Primal and Vengeful.**_ White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.\n\nA white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.\n\nThough only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.\n\n_**Lone Masters.**_ White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.\n\nWhite dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.\n\nPowerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.\n\n_**Treasure Under Ice.**_ White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.\n\nLoose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.\n\nA white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.",

The dragon enjoys devising increasingly hazardous routes for the kobolds to tackle.\n```\n\n**White Dragon Lairs**\n\nA white dragon's lair is a place of freezing temperatures and profound solitude. Forgotten mountain holds, inaccessible chasms, and frozen caverns buried deep beneath glacial ice are typical of the places white dragons seek out to make their homes.\n\nWhite dragons enjoy the mournful sound of the wind and frequently choose lairs with long, winding tunnels down which icy gusts can travel. They seldom work to improve their lairs, but when they do, it is often to channel wind currents to create effects the dragon finds pleasing. The labyrinthine tunnels and the mirror-like icy surfaces in a white dragon's lair confound would-be thieves and might foil their escape.\n\n**White Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe white dragon lair shown in [map 5.15](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map515whitedragonlair \"map 5.15\") is a natural stone grotto set in a cliff side capped by a glacial ice sheet. It has the following features:\n\n**Cave Entrance.** The entrance is a cave that opens into the cliff's rocky base. When the dragon goes out hunting, a wall of ice blocks the cave's entrance. But while in residence, the dragon leaves the cave mouth open to let the lair \"breathe.\"\n\n**Frozen Stream.** The cave's interior is a twisting stone tunnel carved out by a subterranean stream, now frozen over by the dragon's presence. The stream spills down in stages over low, frozen cascades, creating an icy stairway.\n\n**Dining Hall.** A small chamber adjoining the stream just inside the cave's entrance is the dragon's dining hall; it contains the horrid remnants of recent meals.\n\n**Rocky Grotto.** Past the topmost cascade is the grotto floor, a rocky cavern dimly lit by blue light filtering through the icy vault high above. The largest of the dragon's frozen trophies are scattered about the grotto.\n\n**Low Cavern.** Beyond the grotto, the stream leads to a low-ceilinged cavern the dragon used as a sleeping place when smaller; it might now serve as a home for the dragon's minions.\n\n**Upper Cavern.** High above the grotto floor is a large cave where the dragon rests and stores the bulk of the dragon's hoard. The cave opens onto a narrow stone shelf that juts out from the grotto's walls and nearly encircles it. The shelf is stable but icy, and there is no obvious means of reaching it except for flying or scaling the sheer rock walls.\n\n**Icy Dome.** Above the shelf is a frozen dome riddled with icicles. The ice here is just thin enough for the dragon to burst through to the open air if a quick escape is necessary.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Blinding Sleet.** Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Whirling Wind.** A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the _[Dungeon Master's Guide](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg \"Dungeon Master's Guide\")_ for rules on [strong wind](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#StrongWind \"strong wind\")). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Biting Chill.** Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the _[Dungeon Master's Guide](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg \"Dungeon Master's Guide\")_ for rules on [extreme cold](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeCold \"extreme cold\")). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.\n\n**Mirror Ice.** The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.",
    "lair": "**A White Dragon's Lair**\n\nWhite dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.\n\nA legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.\n\nA white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n- Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.\n- The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary white dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.\n- Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.\n- Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.\nIf the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days."

These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms.

Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips.

The resulting famine is devastating the countryside.\n|    3 | Rival realms are secretly being driven to war by the machinations of a black dragon, who hopes to revel in the resulting carnage.\n|    4 | When swamplands shrink due to a prolonged drought, two black dragons form a temporary alliance to destroy a nearby town for more living space.\n|    5 | The acidic bile of a black dragon is the only substance able to melt the lock of a despot's vault.\n|    6 | A potent artifact is rumored to lie in the ruins where a black dragon dwells.\n|    7 | A group of adventurers and a black dragon are hunting the same treasure in the ruins of a partially sunken city.\n|    8 | A black dragon with epicurean tastes is poaching game in a noble's hunting preserve at a frightening pace.\n```\n\n**Connected Creatures**\n\nBlack dragons prefer the company of creatures that are easy to control and present little threat of betrayal. Mindless Undead, shambling mounds, carnivorous flora, Oozes, and Constructs make appealing servants, especially working in concert with a black dragon's fiendishly clever traps. A black dragon's intelligent followers tend to worship draconic majesty and typically include kobolds, troglodytes, lizard folk, and (more rarely) yuan-ti.\n\n**Ancient Black Dragon Connections**\n\n```\n|   d4 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | An ancient black dragon, after studying blasphemous texts dedicated to alien gods, issues a warning that a corrupted planetar will soon fall to earth like a meteor in the fens outside a great city's walls.\n|    2 | An illithid community has spent nearly a millennium raising and preparing a black dragon to become an elder brain dragon (described in chapter 6), so the elder brain can wreak ruin upon its rivals.\n|    3 | The decades-long machinations of an ancient black dragon and an evil archmage are nearing fruition. If their pact succeeds, they will unleash devastation on a continental scale.\n|    4 | An ancient black dragon rules a vast, decadent city built on artificial islands within a polluted lake. The site is threatened with destruction by an enraged archdruid--but destroying the city means thousands of innocents will die.\n```\n\n**Black Dragon Lairs**\n\nBlack dragons prefer to lair in swamps and jungles--the more dismal and fetid, the better. Within those environs, they favor ruins for their defensibility and dreary aesthetic.\n\nWhen choosing their lairs, black dragons are fond of locations that are naturally constraining and confounding. Whether adventurers seeking the dragon must wind their way through the roots of an ancient mangrove swamp or brave a trap-filled boggy ruin, the experience promises to be a deadly affair.\n\n**Black Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe black dragon lair shown in [map 5.2](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map52blackdragonlair \"map 5.2\") is a derelict chapel, lost to time in a gloomy fen. The building's wooden framing rotted away long ago, leaving a looming skeleton of lichen-covered stone and a lone tower. The lair has the following features:\n\n**Swampy Lake.** Abutting the chapel is a swampy lake where the dragon sleeps. The foul water stinks of dead fish and rot, while the dense foliage and scraggly trees along the shoreline writhe with scuttling, slithering fauna. A thick blanket of fog--part of the dragon's corrupting influence--adds a claustrophobic feel to the lair.\n\n**Chapel Floor.** Columns of clammy stone jut like ribs from the chapel's exposed floor, as if in mockery of the sanctity of this once-holy place.\n\n**Underground.** Twin staircases in the main hall descend to a partially flooded crypt. Five trapped stone sarcophagi rise above the waterline, their lids depicting armored warriors whose faces have been scoured away by acid. Each sarcophagus holds a few coins and shiny baubles mixed with junk that appears to be treasure at first glance. In the tower basement, a fully submerged tunnel leads to the lake where the dragon sleeps.\n\n**Chapel Tower.** A swollen oak door, flanked by worn carvings of noble warriors, opens into the dank stone tower, which stands empty except for a chipped staircase that climbs to a second floor and then ends in midair before reaching the crumbling third level. Mold-covered friezes of knights kneeling before angelic beings line the stairwell.\n\n**Tower Top.** The dragon's true hoard is kept safely at the top of the crumbling tower, where the dragon enjoys perching and staring out into the gloom. Intruders who can't fly must scale the sheer, slimy walls of the tower (either from outside or from the interior of the second floor), braving whatever traps might be in store if they hope to claim the dragon's real treasures.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) black dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Filth Burst.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is difficult terrain.\n\n**Grasping Muck.** Tendrils of roiling muck extend from the dragon's lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon's choice that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Noxious Gas.** A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a black dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Ennui.** Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair are filled with listless despair.\n\n**Grating Spies.** Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6 miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The dragon can suppress this effect at will.\n\n**Rotting Domain.** Stinging bugs are aggressive and the air is heavy with the odor of rot within 6 miles of the lair.",
    "lair": "Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.\n- A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d10) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d10) piercing damage.\n- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.\n- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.\nFog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.\n\nIf the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days."

    "monster_name": "Ancient Blue Dragon",
    "characteristics": null,
    "long": "Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.\n\nA blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.\n\nA blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.\n\n_**Vain and Deadly.**_ A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.\n\nA blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.\n\n_**Desert Predators.**_ Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.\n\nWhen it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.\n\n_**Overlords and Minions.**_ Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.\n\nA blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.\n\n_**Hoarders of Gems.**_ Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.\n\nA blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.",

Though territorial, they are willing to allow creatures they consider their servants to live peacefully within their domains. Blue dragons are also more family oriented than many other dragons, and it's not unusual to find a multigenerational extended family of blue dragons sharing a territory. Other creatures need to tread carefully in such a place, for any injury or insult to one of the dragons is considered a strike against the whole family.\n\n**Ancient Blue Dragon Connections**\n\n```\n|   d4 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | An ancient blue dragon is worried that no members of the younger generation are strong enough to inherit the ancient dragon's territory, and this elder is trying to start a war to test the younger dragons and determine which, if any, might be a worthy heir.\n|    2 | An ancient blue dragon without offspring has adopted wyrmlings of various colors--including a number stolen from the wyrmlings' parents.\n|    3 | An ancient blue dragon is training an androsphinx as heir to the region the dragon rules and searching for magic items that will allow the sphinx to control the weather as the dragon does.\n|    4 | Under the pretense of helping an ancient blue dragon become a dracolich, an archmage is actually hoping to claim the dragon's vast hoard.\n```\n\n**Blue Dragon Lairs**\n\nBlue dragons make their lairs in deserts and other arid landscapes. They prefer warm climates, but if an otherwise ideal potential lair presents itself in a cold environment, they find ways to adapt. Instead of seeking out lofty domiciles, blue dragons build their lairs underground, burrowing beneath sand or using magic to hew rock into an intricate warren of rooms and tunnels that can be expanded to accommodate a growing family. Still, they appreciate the tactical advantages of height and usually create their lairs near a spire or cliff from which they can keep watch over their territory.\n\nThough most blue dragons would be loath to the use the term themselves, their lairs are often surprisingly homey. They favor lairs that balance beauty and comfort and adorn them in soothing shades of blue, purple, and green.\n\n**Blue Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe blue dragon lair shown in [map 5.3](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map53bluedragonlair \"map 5.3\") is built in the ruins of an ancient city swallowed by desert sands. Some of the lair's chambers still contain the remnants of temples and other structures. The traces of this metropolis suggest that it was of significant size, but very little of it remains accessible in the area of the lair, since the dragon has collapsed the lair on intruders multiple times, rebuilding in a nearby portion of the ruins each time.\n\nThe walls of the lair are crystallized glass formed by the dragon's lightning breath. Most of its floors are loosely packed sand, with patches of rough stone showing through in some areas. The dragon has constructed a system of mirrors to bring in sunlight from chambers open to the sky, a system that not only brightly lights the interior but also heats the sand to a comfortable basking temperature.\n\nThe lair has the following features:\n\n**Entrance Chamber.** An open central cavern is the lair's primary entrance. The glass walls rise 30 feet to the surface and are fused with carved stone pillars and partial walls from the ancient city. A narrow, jagged piece of granite juts out horizontally from the wall near the top of the chamber, providing a perch from which the dragon can survey the cavern. The sand covering the floor of the chamber sometimes ripples or swirls ominously, perhaps in response to unpredictable desert winds, the dragon's magic, or some creature lurking beneath the sand.\n\n**Hoard Display.** Just off the entrance chamber (toward the left side of the map), a smaller cavern with a worked stone floor contains the dragon's artfully arranged hoard. The glass walls of this chamber are studded with blue gems, and narrow light wells let in sunlight that bathes the room in dappled blue light. The ancient stone tiles on the floor contain lightning-charged traps to blast intruders.\n\n**Dragon's Den.** The dragon sleeps in a large chamber in the bottom right of the map. The den is a well-preserved remnant of the ancient city; this gracious, elegant space is hung with silk curtains in shades of blue and purple, and its worked-stone floor is covered with plush, patterned rugs in complementary hues. It features a bejeweled and cushioned dais on which the dragon often reclines.\n\n**Private Entrance.** Just above and to the right of the den is a small chamber open to the sky that the dragon uses as a private entrance to the lair. A secret door prevents unwitting creatures from wandering directly into the den.\n\n**Treasury.** At the left end of the den, a door set under a blue-tiled arch leads to a smaller room where the dragon keeps relics that are too precious for the main hoard or that don't match the hoard's overall aesthetic.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) blue dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Misleading Mirage.** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.\n\n**Sudden Sinkhole.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the pit.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Blue Luster.** Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.\n\n**Mirage Terrain.** The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.\n\n**Sandstorm.** A sandstorm blows constantly within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.",
    "lair": "Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.\n\nThunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense.\n\nA blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions -- along with the wealth of the dead intruders.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.\n- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n- Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.\n- Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (\u22125).\n- Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 \u00d7 10 feet into the sinkhole.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are."

    "long": "The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.\n\nA brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.\n\n_**Boldly Talkative.**_ A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.\n\nA brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.\n\n_**Prized Treasures.**_ Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.\n\nBrass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.",

They favor the company of such creatures over all others, often to the point of not bothering to gather minions to do their bidding and ignoring worshipers who fawn over them.\n\n**Ancient Brass Dragon Connections**\n\n```\n|   d4 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | An ancient brass dragon once ruled a temple-state through a puppet sovereign, who is now a mummy lord ruling a city of ghouls that owe the dragon fealty.\n|    2 | An ancient brass dragon believes that a local androsphinx is an insufferable know-it-all with no sense of humor and enjoys playing pranks on the sphinx.\n|    3 | An ancient brass dragon and an ancient blue dragon have a centuries-old rivalry, and each dragon manipulates adventurers into harassing the other.\n|    4 | An ancient brass dragon rules a mighty city whose folk have erected massive stone monuments to honor the dragon over the centuries.\n```\n\n**Brass Dragon Lairs**\n\nBrass dragons prefer to make their lairs in hot, dry, rocky areas--desert canyons, caves beneath arid mesas, or ancient stone ruins. Brass dragons often compete with blue dragons for lair sites, but are more likely to make a lair among rocks than to burrow under the sands.\n\nBrass dragons like their lairs to be spacious and well lit; many lairs feature windows or skylights to let sunlight in. They respect skillfully wrought stonework and often take over canyon fortresses and similar structures when they're abandoned by their original non-dragon builders. Brass dragons are also capable of fine stonework themselves, and many meticulously carve out grand halls and galleries in which to store and display their hoards.\n\n**Brass Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe brass dragon lair shown in [map 5.4](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map54brassdragonlair \"map 5.4\") is an ancient ruin located within rough, stony canyons in a desert environment. The lair has the following features:\n\n**Column Guardians.** Massive columns carved to resemble warriors watch over the main entrance to the canyons; the dragon has given them whimsical names and ascribed unique personalities to them.\n\n**Grand Hall.** At the deepest part of the canyon, a wide archway admits visitors to the grand hall that serves as the main lair. Regal statues stand bathed in sunlight admitted by huge shafts in the ceiling--wide enough for the dragon to climb up but not fly through. A much larger shaft above the rear chamber allows the dragon to fly directly in and out of the lair.\n\n**Hoard Chamber.** The bulk of the dragon's hoard is stored in a partially collapsed chamber most easily accessed by way of a shaft in the ceiling. (A narrow gap in the fallen stones filling an old passageway might allow a Small or nimble character to squeeze in or out that way.) Eight heavy pillars surround a well in the floor and support the ceiling around the shaft.\n\n**Unused Chamber.** A smaller chamber shown on the left side of the map is not currently used by the dragon, but it shows signs of having been recently used by visitors--either creatures welcomed by the dragon or ones that escaped the dragon's notice.\n\n**Wells.** Four wells--three in the canyons leading to the main hall and one inside the hoard chamber--provide fresh water for the dragon and any guests, and they also serve as a sort of alarm system. As described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_ , whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of one of these wells, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) brass dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Animate Statues.** The dragon chooses up to three statues in the lair that it can see. Each of these statues briefly animates and attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +7 bonus to hit and dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit.\n\n**Blast of Wind.** A mighty wind sweeps through the lair in a direction of the dragon's choice, blowing along a line 40 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature in that area except the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the wind's direction and be knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. If the dragon is within the area of the wind, it can choose to be pushed 15 feet in the wind's direction, and the wind can't knock the dragon prone.\n\n**Obscuring Sand.** Dust and sand fill the air within 120 feet of the dragon, making the area lightly obscured until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a brass dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Cloud Companion.** A small, wispy cloud follows non-evil creatures as they journey within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. It changes direction as the creatures do, remaining interposed between them and the direct glare of the sun, and grants them advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of [extreme heat](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeHeat \"extreme heat\") (see the _[Dungeon Master's Guide](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg \"Dungeon Master's Guide\")_).\n\n**Talkative Denizens.** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find pleasure in hearing the sound of their own voices. The air is filled with a deafening chorus of birds and small animals, and sapient creatures talk extensively.",
    "lair": "**A Brass Dragon's Lair**\n\nA brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.\n- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.\n- Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.\n- Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately."

They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.\n\nA ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.\n\n_**Dragons of the Coast.**_ Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.\n\n_**War Machines.**_ Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.\n\nWhen a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.\n\n_**Well-Organized Wealth.**_ Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.",

Some make dry homes atop lonely sea stacks, while others favor completely submerged lairs in sunken ruins. Many seek out strongholds straddling land and sea, with both dry and flooded chambers.\n\nWhen it comes to lairs, bronze dragons value function over form, and they study potential sites with a military commander's eye for defense. They appreciate the solidity of cliff-side caves or stone fortresses, often reinforcing existing defenses with clever traps and bulwarks. At the same time, bronze dragons understand that they are their own best defense in a siege, so they are careful to maximize their mobility with multiple ways in and out of their lairs.\n\n**Bronze Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe bronze dragon lair shown on [map 5.5](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map55bronzedragonlair \"map 5.5\") is a set of sea caves that once served as a dwarven military outpost. The lair has the following features:\n\n**Sentinel Statue.** In a hidden cove sheltered from the sea, a statue of a dour elf queen watches over a small beach. The statue's eyes are magically warded to alert the dragon of intruders.\n\n**Campaign Chamber.** Beyond the beach stands a pillared dwarven hall whose walls have begun to crumble near the entrances. Here the dragon grants audiences and presides over councils of war, surrounded by trophies chosen to remind viewers of the dragon's heroic history.\n\n**Lofty Alcove.** Up a steep set of stairs at the bottom right of the map lies a dry chamber that serves as barracks for guests and a library for documents too fragile to survive in damp conditions.\n\n**Island Larder.** Another elevated chamber carved into the cliffs of a small island abutting the beach (in the center right of the map) serves as a larder in case of a siege. It also houses a clever series of mirrors arranged throughout the stone to allow the dragon to observe the seascape unnoticed.\n\n**Watery Caves.** Two chambers near the top of the map are accessible only via submerged tunnels, their entrances disguised with thick seaweed and boulders. The larger cavern on the right is the dragon's sleeping chamber, while the smaller on the left holds most of the dragon's hoard.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) bronze dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Ocean's Call.** The dragon conjures a swarm of spectral dolphins. Each creature in the water within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d6) slashing damage; then the swarm vanishes.\n\n**Salt Burst.** The dragon chooses a point it can see in the lair. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point bursts with abrasive salt crystals. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) slashing damage.\n\n**Whelming Water.** The dragon causes a strong current to course through the water in its lair. The dragon chooses any number of creatures it can see that are standing or swimming in water within 120 feet of it. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a bronze dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Phantom Escort.** Ghostly naval ships from an ancient armada appear, escorting well-meaning creatures in need of the dragon's help toward the dragon's lair.\n\n**Underwater Pursuit.** Sailors glimpse the shadowy, illusory form of a dragon in the depths below them, keeping pace with their vessel.\n\n**Unfailing Faithfulness.** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair find it nearly impossible to break a promise.",

The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n- A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it.

Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.\n\nA copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.\n\n_**Good Hosts.**_ A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle.

Although sometimes natural, the passages and caverns of a copper dragon's lair might be carved out or expanded by the dragon's powerful acid breath.\n\nCopper dragon burrows are often sinuous and winding, featuring twists, turns, and dead ends. Blank walls in the lair can conceal cunning hidden passages or might be stone or clay thin enough for the dragon to burst through them. The narrowest tunnels in a copper dragon's lair are just barely wide enough to accommodate the dragon's body, and they typically loop around and reconnect with themselves so the dragon can double back without having to reverse direction.\n\n**Copper Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe copper dragon lair shown in [map 5.6](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map56copperdragonlair \"map 5.6\") is a network of tunnels and large chambers dug beneath dry, rocky hills. The dragon's acid breath has left the surface of the stone here with a smooth, melted appearance.\n\nThe lair has the following features:\n\n**Concealed Entrances.** Four sloping tunnels emerge onto the surface among the hills, concealed by brush and tumbled stone. These openings allow the dragon to enter and depart the lair via multiple routes. Additionally, the sunken areas shown on the surface map correspond to areas where the dragon can burst through the ceiling to reach the surface.\n\n**Secret Doors.** Concealed passages connect a number of the tunnels and chambers of the lair. Their secret doors are magical in nature, with the stone at a passage junction reshaping itself at the dragon's command to open a passage or close it again (similar to the effect of a stone shape spell). Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 10 feet of one of these secret doors, the dragon becomes aware of that creature's presence and location. Each secret door radiates an aura of transmutation magic but is otherwise indistinguishable from solid stone.\n\n**Hoard Chamber.** At the bottom of the underground map, a chamber hidden beyond two secret passages and carved out beneath a low hill contains the bulk of the dragon's hoard. The dragon often sleeps in the adjoining chamber, acting as a final line of defense against intruders.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) copper dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Laughing Gas.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A cloud of pink gas fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area that fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is incapacitated with laughter until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Torpid Energy.** The dragon chooses a creature it can see within 120 feet of it. If the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, its speed is halved, and it can't use reactions or bonus actions until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nEither of these effects might appear in the area around a copper dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Distant Melodies.** The ethereal music of woodwinds and bells can be heard carried on the wind within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.\n\n**Starlit Stones.** Standing stones are common on hilltops within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The stones shed dim light in a 10-foot radius at night. (If the dragon dies, the stones remain, but they no longer shed light.)",
    "lair": "**A Copper Dragon's Lair**\n\nCopper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n- The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.\n- Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts.\n- Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10 days. The other effects end immediately."

    "long": "The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.\n\nA gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.\n\n**_Devourer of Wealth._** Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.\n\n_**Reserved Shapeshifters.**_ Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.\n\nOlder gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or weeks on end.\n\n_**Master Hoarders.**_ A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.",

If villains can be reformed without violence, all the better.\n|    2 | Shorter-lived species often have difficulty perceiving the full scope of time's tapestry and lack the patience for my appropriately thorough explanations.\n|    3 | Others might find me cold and dispassionate, but such is the price of perspective. Few creatures enjoy confronting the relative smallness of their lives.\n|    4 | Disguises allow me to bestow small kindnesses and experience the simple pleasures of companionship without constantly being petitioned. I'm proud of my acting ability and never break character.\n|    5 | The future is writ large in the patterns of history. I enjoy conversing with others who think critically about history and society.\n|    6 | I enjoy gifts but find attempts to hire or bribe me deeply offensive.\n|    7 | My reclusiveness is a filter. If someone lacks the motivation to overcome my barriers, then their matter is unworthy of my attention.\n|    8 | On a long enough timescale, all actions are meaningless. So why should I deny myself anything?\n```\n\n**Gold Dragon Ideals**\n\n```\n|   d6 | Ideal\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | Foresight. Righteous action requires carefully weighing potential consequences to ensure the cure is not worse than the disease. (Lawful)\n|    2 | Restraint. I cannot right every wrong. I encourage others to solve their own problems, and I save my strength for tribulations only I can address. (Any)\n|    3 | Stewardship. I do not serve individuals, but rather history. By acting strategically, I tip the ultimate balance toward justice and virtue. (Good)\n|    4 | Objectivity. I remain impartial in my judgments and refuse to let personal feelings get in the way of what's fair or necessary. (Lawful)\n|    5 | Isolation. Every interaction has ramifications that stretch on into infinity. I curate my impact on the world by remaining aloof and self-reliant. (Any)\n|    6 | Sovereignty. Other creatures lack my wisdom and must be controlled to prevent wrongdoing.

The dragon is recruiting trackers to locate the scholar, while the scholar tries to hire bodyguards.\n|    3 | A gold dragon seeks to vanquish evil by conquering and uniting all nations under a totalitarian government that will enforce the dragon's benevolent laws.\n|    4 | A gold dragon has been attacking travelers in an effort to drive them away from the dragon's territory, which holds a deadly artifact at its center.\n|    5 | A gold dragon has decided to burn a plague- infected city to the ground, sacrificing the residents to limit the contagion's spread.\n|    6 | A gold dragon needs agents to infiltrate a magical prison complex and liberate the dragon's monk companion, who has been unjustly sentenced.\n|    7 | A gold dragon demands reparations from a city whose rulers sent adventurers to steal from the dragon's hoard.\n|    8 | A gold dragon requires a team of specialists to help break into the infamous Lamentation Vault and acquire the world-shaking prophecy held within.\n```\n\n**Connected Creatures**\n\nGold dragons tend to hold themselves apart from the worlds they watch over, favoring isolation and trusting only a few close allies and guardians. When they do walk among other creatures, they prefer to do so in disguise, relishing the opportunity to see the world through different eyes.\n\n**Ancient Gold Dragon Connections**\n\n```\n|   d4 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | A solar who admires an ancient gold dragon campaigns to recruit the dragon into the service of the solar's god.\n|    2 | An ancient gold dragon is infatuated with an oblivious empyrean, drawn in by the empyrean's carefree nature and larger-than-life emotions.\n|    3 | An ancient gold dragon and a lich have vied to bend history to their respective wills. The two have reluctantly come to understand and empathize with each other.\n|    4 | An ancient gold dragon takes little interest in the day-to-day governance of a powerful empire. But the dragon expects to be obeyed completely when deigning to address the populace.\n```\n\n**Gold Dragon Lairs**\n\nDespite their affection for people and their diverse cultures, gold dragons typically make their lairs in hidden places far from civilization, where only the most desperate and dedicated can find them. Many live in the ruins of vanished cultures, appreciating the beautiful inevitability of entropy and the reminder of how easily progress can be lost without careful tending. Crumbling shrines, towers reclaimed by the wilderness, and fallen fortresses all appeal to a gold dragon's sense of history--though they can be equally enraptured by picturesque natural settings. A gold dragon lair almost always involves water, be it a river, a lake, or an ocean shore.\n\n**Gold Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe gold dragon lair shown in [map 5.9](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map59golddragonlair \"map 5.9\") occupies a misty river gorge and has the following features:\n\n**Waterfall Cave.** A rushing river cascades over the cliff in a scintillating waterfall, concealing the entrance to the dragon's cavern complex. Past this thundering curtain, a cave opens into the grand hall.\n\n**Grand Hall.** Six glowing crystalline columns support the ceiling of this cave. The columns' colors reflect the dragon's mood, and they can animate to defend the lair.\n\n**Gallery.** A passageway running left from the grand hall is lined with busts of allies and enemies from the dragon's past. This area contains the _water mirror_, a magical glass case filled by seepage from the river above, which the dragon uses to scry across both distance and time.\n\n**Sleeping Chamber.** At the end of the gallery passage, the dragon's sleeping chamber opens up, its walls lined with shelves holding books and useful magic items.\n\n**Treasury Hall.** Armored doors within the sleeping chamber lead to the dragon's treasury hall, which features an 80-foot sheer drop into a viewing gallery.\n\n**Hoard and Vault.** A chamber on the right side of the treasury hall holds the dragon's hoard, which serves to distract would-be thieves from a store of dangerous and corrupting artifacts hidden in a secret vault opposite the hoard chamber.\n\n**Pantry.** A rough chamber off the right side of the great hall acts as the dragon's pantry, holding racks of pearls and other gems.\n\n**Apartments.** In the top right corner of the map, a worked-stone alcove leads to Humanoid-scale apartments to accommodate the dragon's most honored comrades, as well as the dragon in Humanoid form.\n\n**Pavilions.** Outside the lair, weathered pavilions climb the cliffs overlooking the waterfall's plunge pool, offering a convenient place for the dragon to meet visitors. Beyond the pavilions, an elegant pathway winds through self-manicuring gardens before ending abruptly in trackless wilderness.\n\n**Additional Lair Action**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) gold dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:\n\n**Beguiling Glow.** Warm light fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon; each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a gold dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Beneficent Trail.** Within 10 miles of the dragon's lair, small runes in the shape of a gold dragon appear to creatures in great need, marking a subtle trail leading to the dragon's lair.\n\n**Emanation of Justice.** Creatures that spend a year within 6 miles of the dragon's lair value fairness and justice over their personal feelings.\n\n**Liar's Revelation.** Within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, any creature attempting to tell a deliberate lie must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or find itself accidentally revealing the truth it was attempting to conceal. The first time a creature fails this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.",
    "lair": "**A Gold Dragon's Lair**\n\nGold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n- One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.\n- Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil creatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.\n- Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.\n\nIf the dragon dies, these effects end immediately."

A green dragon is recognized by the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull.",
    "long": "The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.\n\nA green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.\n\nA wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.\n\nA green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.\n\n_**Capricious Hunters.**_ A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.\n\nGreen dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.\n\nA green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.\n\n_**Manipulative Schemers.**_ A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.\n\nWhen manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.\n\n_**Conflict and Corruption.**_ Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch -- sometimes for decades -- for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.\n\nGreen dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.\n\n_**Living Treasures.**_ A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.",

An older green dragon might indulge in horticulture, cultivating the local flora as befits their individual aesthetic. However, most green dragons are content to either excavate beneath trees and nestle among the roots or make lairs inside trees large enough to be hollowed out without compromising their structure.\n\nGreen dragons take great interest in woodland settlements when seeking lair sites. Though they are fully capable of modifying forests to their own liking, they find it easier and vastly more entertaining to take something belonging to smaller and weaker beings.\n\n**Green Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe green dragon lair shown in [map 5.10](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map510greendragonlair \"map 5.10\") was an enormous banyan tree once sacred to the wood elves who lived around it. The original host tree around which the banyan tree grew is now dead and has rotted away, leaving a large columnar shaft within the trunk of the banyan that the dragon has expanded into a subterranean lair. The banyan continues to grow and to swallow up other nearby trees.\n\nThe lair has the following features:\n\n**Canopy.** The green dragon has teased the banyan's sprawling canopy into a bowl-like shape within which the dragon can comfortably lounge. Threaded through the branches are bones from the dragon's meals--some messily clustered among the leaves, and others deliberately arranged to create macabre dioramas for the dragon's amusement. Such grisly scenes can also be seen scattered throughout the lair as reminders of the dragon's power, and as distractions and warnings for would-be interlopers.\n\n**Underground.** The hollow center of the tree gives access to the dragon's lair below, nestled among the banyan's sprawling roots. Three tunnels branch off from the vertical shaft at different levels--none of them at the very bottom. This means a creature that falls to the bottom must find a way to ascend at least as far as the lowest tunnel.\n\n**Hoard Chamber.** All three passages eventually converge in the large chamber at the right side of the map, where most of the dragon's hoard is kept.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Creeper Vines.** The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become zombies (see their entry in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_). The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.\n\n**Lashing Root.** One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nEither or both of these effects might appear in the area around a green dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of those described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Inviting Whispers.** Whispers rustle in the foliage within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.\n\n**Twisted Messengers.** The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature's throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon's own in order to allow the dragon's voice to issue forth.",
    "lair": "The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.\n\nAt the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n- A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n- Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.\nEach 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.\n- Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.\n- Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns."

    "long": "The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.\n\nThe odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.\n\nThe scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.\n\n_**Mountain Masters.**_ Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.\n\n_**Arrogant Tyrants.**_ Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.\n\nNo other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.\n\n_**Status and Servants.**_ Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.\n\nWhen it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.\n\n_**Obsessive Collectors.**_ Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.\n\nA red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.",

Lairs with natural geothermal or lava vents are highly sought after, as these features create an environment ideally suited to the dragons' taste.\n\nMinions often attend red dragons in their lairs. These servants keep the place swept clean of refuse and watch out for intruders, while providing the imperious dragon with subjects to bully and command. Some minions worship the dragon and serve willingly, but others would escape if they could.\n\n**Red Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe red dragon lair shown in [map 5.11](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map511reddragonlair) is inside the caldera of an active volcano. Azers dug out and expanded the lava tunnels within the volcano's peak, just above the level of the caldera's lava pools. Although the azers are long since gone, their construction--and much of their lost wealth--now serves the dragon's needs. That construction also provides a network of tunnels too small for the dragon to use, but where other creatures can make their lairs.\n\nThe lair has the following features:\n\n**Caldera.** The steep sides of the caldera drop away from the edge of the cone, making a 60-foot descent to the lava below. The rough rock of the caldera is not overly difficult to climb, but the area grows increasingly hot as creatures descend.\n\n**Pillared Hall.** The dragon sleeps in the large hall on the left edge of the map, where a row of crumbling pillars supports the ceiling and a narrow channel of lava keeps the hall hot.\n\n**Hoard.** A side tunnel off the pillared hall descends 30 feet down a steep lava tube to a ledge above a pool of magma. Here the dragon has piled a hoard that gleams in the dull red light.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) red dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Noxious Smoke.** A cloud of thick, dark smoke fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature other than the dragon that starts its turn in the cloud or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. The cloud lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Searing Heat.** Searing heat spreads out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature that enters the affected area or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The heat lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a red dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm)_:\n\n**Desertification.** Precipitation is almost nonexistent within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, making the land parched and arid and most plant life withered and brown.\n\n**Fiery Senses.** The dragon can hear up to 30 feet through any open flame within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.\n\n**Ominous Flames.** Open flames within 6 miles of the dragon's lair are tinged dark red, hiss and crackle constantly, and throw off embers and showers of sparks.",
    "lair": "**A Red Dragon's Lair**\n\nRed dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.\n\nWith its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls--and the wider world it seeks to control.\n\nThroughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n- A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.\n- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.\n- Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.\n\nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days."

    "long": "The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.\n\nA silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.\n\n_**Dragons of Virtue.**_ Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.\n\n_**Friends of the Small Races.**_ Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.\n\nSilver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.\n\n_**Respect for Humanity.**_ Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.\n\n_**Hoarding History.**_ Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.",

Often, this has less to do with concerns such as security and privacy, and more to do with meeting or exceeding expectations. If humans, elves, and dwarves expect dragons to be found in such lofty environs, that's what they'll get.\n\nThis inclination toward using high-altitude locales as sites for lairs isn't without complications, though. Silver dragons often end up in competition with other dragons, notably red dragons, for control of such places. And even after establishing their lairs, silver dragons often need to fight to protect their dominion.\n\nThe lair of a silver dragon is always an impressive sight. Young dragons make their homes in icy cliffs, excavating space for themselves within the mountainside. Older silver dragons sometimes decorate their cliff-side habitats with ruins carefully collected from other places in the world. Depending on the dragon, a lair can be a multi-tiered affair, with its highest levels extending fully into the sky.\n\n**Silver Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe silver dragon lair shown in [map 5.13](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map513silverdragonlair \"map 5.13\") is composed of three connected sections--an antechamber, an open court, and a majestic temple. The lair has the following features:\n\n**Antechamber.** The antechamber was once an ancient throne room or mountain shrine, but time has eroded any clues as to its original builders. Its walls are hung with velvet tapestries featuring heroic figures performing a variety of glorious acts.\n\n**Side Chambers.** A few small private side chambers allow the dragon (usually in Humanoid guise) to meet with visitors.\n\n**Cloud Bridge.** From the antechamber, visitors travel upward along a path of clouds. The impressive route is not as dangerous as its lack of railings and the literal airiness of each footstep might suggest.\n\n**Open Court.** Past the cloud bridge is an enormous expanse of smooth stone ringed with broken pillars, where the silver dragon hosts visitors in grand style. Though this court is often surrounded by clouds, the dragon can clear them away with a moment's thought, revealing a breathtaking view of the surrounding region.\n\n**Majestic Temple.** The final section of the lair is a grand domed temple set with a plethora of comfortable furnishings. Here and there, souvenirs from the silver dragon's long life are positioned with great care.\n\n**Under Temple.** A broad shaft in the temple opens into a treasury chamber below, where the dragon's hoard is arranged in gleaming splendor.\n\n**Additional Lair Action**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) silver dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:\n\n**Icy Grip.** A sudden, supernatural chill fills the lair near the dragon. Each creature of the dragon's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures that have resistance to cold damage have advantage on the saving throw; creatures that have immunity to cold damage succeed automatically.",
    "lair": "**A Silver Dragon's Lair**\n\nSilver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n- A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.\n\n- Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.\n- Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon's or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.\n- Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.\n\nIf the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days."

    "monster_id": 16784,
    "monster_name": "Ancient White Dragon",
    "characteristics": null,
    "long": "The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.\n\nA white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.\n\n_**Primal and Vengeful.**_ White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.\n\nA white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.\n\nThough only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.\n\n_**Lone Masters.**_ White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.\n\nWhite dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.\n\nPowerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.\n\n_**Treasure Under Ice.**_ White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.\n\nLoose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.\n\nA white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.",

More often, white dragons encountered in the company of other creatures have been forced into an uneasy accommodation or a resentful servitude because they lack the power to dominate those companions outright.\n\n**Ancient White Dragon Connections**\n\n```\n|   d4 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | A death knight and an ancient white dragon swap tales of old foes and unanswered grievances, nursing the hunger for vengeance that sustains them.\n|    2 | An ancient white dragon makes intermittent assaults against a mated pair of adult silver dragons who lair nearby.\n|    3 | An ancient white dragon guards a lich's phylactery, keeping it sealed in a tomb of ice.

They've been venerating the dragon so long that the dragon now believes the story and speaks proudly in Orc about the orcs' triumphs.\n```\n\n**White Dragon Lairs**\n\nA white dragon's lair is a place of freezing temperatures and profound solitude. Forgotten mountain holds, inaccessible chasms, and frozen caverns buried deep beneath glacial ice are typical of the places white dragons seek out to make their homes.\n\nWhite dragons enjoy the mournful sound of the wind and frequently choose lairs with long, winding tunnels down which icy gusts can travel. They seldom work to improve their lairs, but when they do, it is often to channel wind currents to create effects the dragon finds pleasing. The labyrinthine tunnels and the mirror-like icy surfaces in a white dragon's lair confound would-be thieves and might foil their escape.\n\n**White Dragon Lair Features**\n\nThe white dragon lair shown in [map 5.15](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map515whitedragonlair \"map 5.15\") is a natural stone grotto set in a cliff side capped by a glacial ice sheet. It has the following features:\n\n**Cave Entrance.** The entrance is a cave that opens into the cliff's rocky base. When the dragon goes out hunting, a wall of ice blocks the cave's entrance. But while in residence, the dragon leaves the cave mouth open to let the lair \"breathe.\"\n\n**Frozen Stream.** The cave's interior is a twisting stone tunnel carved out by a subterranean stream, now frozen over by the dragon's presence. The stream spills down in stages over low, frozen cascades, creating an icy stairway.\n\n**Dining Hall.** A small chamber adjoining the stream just inside the cave's entrance is the dragon's dining hall; it contains the horrid remnants of recent meals.\n\n**Rocky Grotto.** Past the topmost cascade is the grotto floor, a rocky cavern dimly lit by blue light filtering through the icy vault high above. The largest of the dragon's frozen trophies are scattered about the grotto.\n\n**Low Cavern.** Beyond the grotto, the stream leads to a low-ceilinged cavern the dragon used as a sleeping place when smaller; it might now serve as a home for the dragon's minions.\n\n**Upper Cavern.** High above the grotto floor is a large cave where the dragon rests and stores the bulk of the dragon's hoard. The cave opens onto a narrow stone shelf that juts out from the grotto's walls and nearly encircles it. The shelf is stable but icy, and there is no obvious means of reaching it except for flying or scaling the sheer rock walls.\n\n**Icy Dome.** Above the shelf is a frozen dome riddled with icicles. The ice here is just thin enough for the dragon to burst through to the open air if a quick escape is necessary.\n\n**Additional Lair Actions**\n\nAt your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:\n\n**Blinding Sleet.** Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n**Whirling Wind.** A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the _[Dungeon Master's Guide](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg \"Dungeon Master's Guide\")_ for rules on [strong wind](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#StrongWind \"strong wind\")). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nAny of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_:\n\n**Biting Chill.** Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the _[Dungeon Master's Guide](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg \"Dungeon Master's Guide\")_ for rules on [extreme cold](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeCold \"extreme cold\")). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.\n\n**Mirror Ice.** The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.",
    "lair": "**A White Dragon's Lair**\n\nWhite dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.\n\nA legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.\n\nA white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n- Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.\n- The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a legendary white dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.\n- Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.\n- Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.\nIf the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.\n\nIf the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days."

    "long": "An androsphinx bears the head of a humanoid male on its lion's body. Outwardly gruff and downcast, it often begins conversations with insults or negative observations. Beneath this gruff exterior, however, an androsphinx has a noble heart. It has no wish to lie or deceive, but it doesn't give away information readily, choosing its words as wisely as it guards its secrets.\n\nAn androsphinx tests the courage and valor of supplicants, not only by forcing them to complete quests but also with its terrible roar, which echoes for miles as it terrifies and deafens nearby creatures. Those who pass its tests may be rewarded with a heroes' feast.\n\n_**Divine Guardians.**_ Sphinxes test the worth of those who seek the treasures of the gods, whether forgotten secrets or mighty spells, artifacts or magical gateways. Creatures that choose to face a sphinx's test are bound to that test unto death, and only those worthy will survive it. The rest the sphinx destroys.\n\nSome sphinxes are high priests of the gods that create them, but most are simply embodied spirits, brought into the mortal realm by devout prayer or direct intervention. A sphinx maintains its vigil tirelessly, not needing to sleep or eat. It rarely engages with others of its kind, knowing no other life except its sacred mission.\n\n_**Magical Tests.**_ The secrets and treasures a sphinx guards remain under divine protection, so that when a creature fails a sphinx's test, the path to the object or knowledge it guards vanishes. Even if a sphinx is attacked and defeated, a quester will still fail to gain the secret it sought -- and will make an enemy of the god that placed the sphinx as a guardian.\n\nBenign deities sometimes grant a sphinx the power to remove supplicants that fail their tests, transporting them away and ensuring that they never encounter the sphinx again. However, those who fail a sphinx's test typically meet a gruesome end beneath its claws.\n\n_**Extraplanar Beings.**_ Mortals that encounter sphinxes do so most often in ancient tombs and ruins, but some sphinxes can access extraplanar realms. A conversation with a sphinx that begins between tumbled stone walls might suddenly shift to an alien locale, such as a life-sized game board or a daunting cliff that must be climbed in a howling storm. Sometimes a sphinx must be summoned from such an extradimensional space, with supplicants calling it from its empty lair. Only those the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm.\n\n_**Fallen Sphinxes.**_ Whether through the weariness of the ages, regret at the slaughter of innocents, or dreams of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to knowledge, some sphinxes break free of their divine command. However, even if a sphinx's alignment and loyalties drift in this way, it never leaves the place it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures it deems worthy.",

The sphinx can choose not to reroll.\n- The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become 1d20 years older or younger (the sphinx's choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A greater restoration spell can restore a creature's age to normal.\n- The flow of time within the lair is altered such that everything within moves up to 10 years forward or backward (sphinx's choice). Only the sphinx is immediately aware of the time change. A wish spell can return the caster and up to seven other creatures designated by the caster to their normal time.\n- The sphinx shifts itself and up to seven other creatures it can see within in its lair to another plane of existence. Once outside its lair, the sphinx can't use lair actions, but it can return to its lair as a bonus action on its turn, taking up to seven creatures with it."

When it hunts, an ankheg burrows upward, waiting below the surface until its antennae detect movement from above. \nThen it bursts from the earth and seizes prey in its mandibles, crushing and grinding while it secretes acidic digestive enzymes. These enzymes help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing, but the ankheg can also squirt acid to take down foes.\n\n_**Bane of Field and Forest.**_ Although ankhegs receive a certain portion of their nutrients from the soil through which they burrow, they must supplement their diet with fresh meat. \nPastures teeming with grazing livestock and forests rife with game are an ankheg's prime hunting grounds. Ankhegs are thus the bane of farmers and rangers everywhere.\n\n_**Earthen Tunnels.**_ As it burrows through earth, the ankheg leaves a narrow, partially collapsed tunnel in its wake. In these tunnels, one might find the remnants of molted ankheg chitin, hatched ankheg eggs, or the grisly remains of ankheg victims, including coins or other treasures scattered during the creature's attack.",

These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.\n\nWith deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.\n\nWhen it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.\n\n_**Brutal and Cruel.**_ All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.\n\nA black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.\n\n_**Foes and Servants.**_ Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.\n\nEvil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.\n\nA black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.\n\nKobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.",

Stone remains behind, wiped clean.\n\n_**Slow Death.**_ An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.\n\nSince not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.\n\n_**Unwitting Servants.**_ Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.\n\n_**Spawn of Juiblex.**_ According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning.

These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.\n\nA blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.\n\nA blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.\n\n_**Vain and Deadly.**_ A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.\n\nA blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.\n\n_**Desert Predators.**_ Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.\n\nWhen it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.\n\n_**Overlords and Minions.**_ Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.\n\nA blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.\n\n_**Hoarders of Gems.**_ Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.\n\nA blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.",

A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.\n\n_**Boldly Talkative.**_ A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.\n\nA brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.\n\n_**Prized Treasures.**_ Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.\n\nBrass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps.

A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field.\n\nA bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability of food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until their panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain.\n\nAll creatures shun bulettes, which treat anything that moves as food -- even other predators and bulettes. Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male's death and consumption.\n\n_**Arcane Creation.**_ Some sages believe the bulette is the result of a mad wizard's experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, with infusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at different times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect that bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.",

In times of need, scattered cloud giant families band together as a unified clan.

As a result, many cloud giants see themselves as having the highest status and power among the giant races. They order lesser giants to seek out wealth and art on their behalf, employing fire giants as smiths and crafters, and using frost giants as reavers, raiders, and plunderers. Dimwitted hill giants serve them as brutes and combat fodder -- sometimes fighting for the cloud giants' amusement. A cloud giant might order hill or frost giants to steal from nearby humanoid lands, which it considers to be a fair tax for its continued beneficence.\n\nOn their mountain summits and solid clouds, cloud giants keep extraordinary gardens. Grapes as big as apples grow there, along with apples the size of pumpkins, and pumpkins the size of wagons. From the errant seeds of these gardens, tales of cottage-sized produce and magic beans are spread in the mortal realm.\n\nAs humanoid nobles keep an aerie for hunting hawks, so do cloud giants keep griffons, perytons, and wyverns as their own flying beasts of prey. Such creatures also patrol the cloud giants' gardens by night, along with trained predators such as owlbears and lions.\n\n_**Children of the Trickster.**_ The patron god and father of the cloud giants is Memnor the Trickster, the cleverest and slyest of the giant deities. Cloud giants align themselves according to the aspects and exploits of Memnor that they most admire, with evil cloud giants emulating his deceitfulness and self-interest and good cloud giants emulating his intellect and silver-tongued speech. Family members usually align in the same direction.\n\n_**Wealth and Power.**_ A cloud giant earns its place in the ordning by the treasure it accumulates, the wealth it wears, and the gifts it bestows on other cloud giants. However, value is only one part of the assessment. The extravagances a cloud giant wears or places about its home must also be beautiful or wondrous. Sacks of gold or gems are worth less to a cloud giant than the jewelry that might be crafted from those materials, creating treasures that bring esteem to a cloud giant's household.\n\nRather than steal from one another or fight over treasures, cloud giants are inveterate gamblers with a hunger for high risks and high rewards. They frequently bet on the outcome of events nominally outside their control, such as the lives of lesser creatures. Ordning ranks and kings' ransoms can be won and lost in bets over the military triumphs of humanoid nations. Fixing wagers by interfering in the conflict causes the loss of the bet, but such deceit is considered to be cheating only if it is discovered. Otherwise, it is cleverness honoring Memnor.",

Regardless of a couatl's task, it prefers to remain hidden, revealing itself only as a last resort.\n\n_**Truth Tellers.**_ A couatl can't lie, but it can withhold information, answer questions vaguely, or allow others to jump to the wrong conclusions if doing so is necessary to protect something, to keep promises, or to hide the secret of its existence.\n\n_**Ancient and Few.**_ A couatl can live for ages without sustenance, even surviving without air, but these creatures can die of disease or the passage of time. A couatl can sense its end up to a century beforehand, but it has no insight into the manner of its demise.\n\nIf a couatl has already accomplished what it set out to do, it accepts its fate. However, if its imminent death endangers the completion of its goals, it actively seeks out another couatl with which to produce offspring.\n\nThe mating ritual of couatls is a beautiful and elaborate dance of magic and light, which results in a gem-like egg from which a new couatl hatches. The parent that sought out the mate raises the newborn couatl and instructs it as to its duties, so that it can complete whatever task the parent leaves unfinished.",

    "long": "Devas are angels that act as divine messengers or agents to the Material Plane, the Shadowfell, and the Feywild and that can assume a form appropriate to the realm they are sent to.\n\nLegend tells of angels that take mortal form for years, lending aid, hope, and courage to goodhearted folk. A deva can take any shape, although it prefers to appear to mortals as an innocuous humanoid or animal. When circumstances require that it cast off its guise, a deva is a beautiful humanoid-like creature with silvery skin. Its hair and eyes gleam with an unearthly luster, and large feathery wings unfurl from its shoulder blades.\n\n---\n\n**Angels**\n\nAn angel is a celestial agent sent forth into the planes to further its god's agenda for weal or woe. Its sublime beauty and presence can drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are destroyers too, and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.\n\n_**Shards of the Divine.**_ Angels are formed from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of great power and foresight.\n\nAngels act out the will of their gods with tireless devotion. Even chaotic good deities command lawful good angels, knowing that the angels' dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands. An angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity. However, an angel is incapable of following commands that stray from the path of law and good.\n\nAn angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.\n\n_**Fallen Angels.**_ An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast.\n\nFallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and compassionate service.\n\n_**Immortal Nature.**_ An angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.",

Creatures of comfort and ease, djinn enjoy succulent fruits, pungent wines, fine perfumes, and beautiful music.\n\nDjinn are known for their sense of mischief and their favorable attitude toward mortals. Among genies, djinn deal coolly with efreet and marids, whom they view as haughty. They openly despise dao and strike against them with little provocation.\n\n_**Masters of the Wind.**_ Masters of the air, the djinn ride powerful whirlwinds that they create and direct on a whim, and which can even carry passengers. Creatures that stand against a djinni are assaulted by wind and thunder, even as the djinni spins away on that wind if outmatched in combat. When a djinni flies, its lower body transforms into a column of swirling air.\n\n_**Accepting Servitors.**_ The djinn believe that servitude is a matter of fate, and that no being can contest the hand of fate. As a result, of all the genies, djinn are the ones most amenable to servitude, though they never enjoy it. Djinn protect those in their employ, treat them kindly, and part with them reluctantly.\n\nA mortal who desires the brief service of a djinni can entreat it with fine gifts, or use flattery to bribe it into compliance. Powerful wizards are able to forgo such niceties, however, if they can summon, bind into service, or imprison a djinni using magic. Long-term service displeases a djinni, and imprisonment is inexcusable. Djinn resent the cruel wizards that have imprisoned their kind in bottles, iron flasks, and wind instruments throughout the ages.

Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature's surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature's name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim's mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.\n\n_**Hedonistic Swindlers.**_ Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim's riches.\n\n_**Changelings.**_ Doppelgangers are too lazy or self-interested to raise their young.

This temperament, combined with their disinterest in moral quandaries, allows them to get along with--or at least abide--most creatures they encounter. They frequently enter symbiotic relationships with other sea creatures that can bring them food or treasure, and they sometimes agree to work for creatures who ply them with generous sums of wealth.\n\n**Adult Dragon Turtle Connections**\n\n```\n|   d8 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | An adult bronze dragon has befriended an adult dragon turtle and is trying to convince the dragon turtle to help fight off an invading navy.\n|    2 | A marid and an adult dragon turtle are traveling companions, touring oceans across the multiverse.\n|    3 | Shambling mounds grow like an infestation on an adult dragon turtle's shell and spread wherever the dragon turtle travels.\n|    4 | An archmage is helping an adult dragon turtle write a definitive history of the deep.\n|    5 | An adult dragon turtle serves as a mount for the storm giant who saved the dragon turtle's life.\n|    6 | An adult dragon turtle hunts an aquatic purple worm that has been hollowing out the reef where the dragon turtle dwells.\n|    7 | An adult dragon turtle has awoken from a decades-long nap to discover that halflings have unwittingly built a seaside tavern upon the dragon turtle's back.\n|    8 | An ultroloth works with an adult dragon turtle living in the River Styx, using magic to protect the dragon turtle from the river's effects and charging travelers for safe passage to the other side.\n```\n\n**Dragon Turtle Lairs**\n\nDragon turtles make their lairs in underwater caves and coral reefs. Most such lairs are situated deep beneath the waves near the ocean's floor, though some dragon turtles prefer coastal lairs with easier access to settlements they can trade with--or prey upon. Particularly reclusive dragon turtles seek lairs in even more remote locales, including deep-sea trenches or underwater volcanoes.\n\nDragon turtles are largely unconcerned with the design of their lairs and seldom work to improve them. A dragon turtle's primary concern when selecting a lair is ensuring that the site is large enough to accommodate the creature's prodigious size as the centuries wear on. After that, proximity to shipping lanes and freedom from irksome neighbors take precedence.\n\n**Dragon Turtle Lair Features**\n\nThe underwater caves inhabited by dragon turtles are structurally similar to the seaside caverns where bronze and topaz dragons lair. When constructing a dragon turtle's lair, you can simply take a coastal map and translate it to an underwater environment or use the map as-is if the dragon turtle is content to lair near the surface.\n\nAs an example, [map 5.14](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map514topazdragonlair \"map 5.14\") depicts a topaz dragon's lair in a seaside cavern, but it could be reimagined as a grotto in the side of a coral reef rising from a shelf on the ocean floor, with the following features:\n\n**Shelf Floor.** The sandy beaches represent the ocean floor at a depth of 100 feet, which is coated in a soft layer of fine sediment. The water around the lair is clear but dimly lit. The water's edge on the map represents the lip of the shelf, which descends to a dark plain twelve hundred feet below.\n\n**Coral Reef.** The rocky cliff side depicts the contours of a coral reef that rises 80 feet above the shelf. The exterior face of the reef is covered with stinging corals.\n\n**Reef Hollow.** The dragon turtle's lair lies in a hollow in the reef's interior that was bored out by a giant sea worm the dragon turtle killed. The original entrance at the level of the shelf floor ascends through a weed-choked tube that opens into the main chamber. Here, the dragon turtle nests in a recessed shelf along the back wall, where the creature can gaze down at the hoard scattered across the chamber floor. Although the lair is mostly flooded with seawater, a layer of breathable air is trapped in the top 3 feet of the main chamber.\n\n**Coral Shelf.** A secondary entrance grants access to a coral shelf 40 feet above the shelf floor and illuminates the lair for a few hours each day with a shaft of dim sunlight.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nAs they are presented in the _[Monster Manual](https://dndbeyond.com/sources/mm \"Monster Manual\")_, dragon turtles don't have access to lair actions while in their lairs. At your discretion, you can give an adult or ancient dragon turtle access to lair actions, increasing its challenge rating by 1. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon turtle can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon turtle can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:\n\n**Blasting Current.** A strong water current moves through the dragon turtle's lair. Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon turtle must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be moved 30 feet in a direction of the dragon turtle's choice. On a success, the creature is moved 10 feet instead.\n\n**Entangling Kelp.** Strands of spectral kelp reach out to ensnare creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the lair that the dragon turtle can see. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Steam Eruption.** Steam erupts in a 15-foot cone from a point on the ground the dragon turtle can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant creatures resistance to this damage.\n\n**Regional Effects**\n\nThe region containing a dragon turtle's lair can be transformed by its presence, creating one or more of the following effects:\n\n**Diverting Currents.** Underwater currents push unwanted visitors away from the lair. While swimming in these currents, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), even if a creature has a swimming speed.\n\n**Elemental Portals.** Crevasses on the ocean floor within 1 mile of the dragon turtle's lair form two-way portals to the Elemental Plane of Water, allowing creatures of elemental water into the world to dwell nearby.\n\n**Hot Water.** Geothermal vents heat the water within 6 miles of the dragon turtle's lair to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIf the dragon turtle dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.",

Using ancient dwarven knowledge, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.\n\nMost duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.\n\n**_Underdark Tyrants._** The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Captivity had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.\n\nDuergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain.\n\n_**Tough as Stone.**_ Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as captives of the illithids. A duergar's mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.\n\n_**Born of Darkness.**_ The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior.

Its long stringy hair hangs in an unkempt mess about its faces, and its breath reeks from mouths filled with crooked teeth and tusks.\n\n_**Dual Personality.**_ The twin heads of an ettin are two individuals trapped in the same brutish body. Each head has its own mind, personality, and name, and possesses unique preferences and quirks. Bound from birth, both minds only rarely experience privacy or solitude. This familiarity breeds contempt, and an ettin bullies and argues with itself constantly, its two heads each taking constant offense at the other's slights.\n\nWhen other creatures refer to an ettin, they combine its double names to form a single compound name that applies to the creature as a whole. If an ettin has one head named Hargle and another named Vargle, other creatures call the ettin Harglevargle.\n\n_**Solitary Lives.**_ As much as an ettin argues with itself, it is even less tolerant of other ettins, since a conversation between two ettins almost always amounts to a shouting match between a crowd of four belligerent heads. Most ettins are solitary creatures as a result, tolerating one another only to reproduce.\n\nAn ettin's twin heads are always the same gender, with a body to match. Females are the dominant gender among ettins, and they initiate the ettins' mating rituals. After finding a suitable den, a female ettin hunts and conquers a male, which cares for and feeds her during her six-month pregnancy. Once the child is born, the male ettin is released from servitude. When the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the mother sends it away and abandons the den.\n\n_**Two Heads Are Better Than One.**_ When focused on a mutually beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin can resolve its personality differences and dedicate itself fully to a task. An ettin fights with a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks directed by its respective heads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads remains ever alert, gaining its only moments of privacy and keeping two eyes open for any creature that disturbs its precious solitude.\n\n_**Orcish Ties.**_ In ancient dialects of Common, the word \"ettin\" translates as \"ugly giant.\" Legends tell of orcs that once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, the magic of which transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Prince of Demons. These creatures scattered into the wilderness to become the first ettins.\n\nWhatever the truth of the ettins' origin, orcs treat them as distant cousins, and orc tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts, and marauders. An ettin isn't particularly loyal to its orc handlers, but the orcs can win it over with the promise of food and loot.",

They are ruthless militaristic brutes whose mastery of metalwork is legendary.\n\n_**Fire Forged.**_ Fire giant fortresses are built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants' forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn. Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the giants' stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke. In more remote outposts, fire giants burn wood to keep their forge fires lit, deforesting leagues of land in all directions.\n\nFire giants shun cold as much as their cousins the frost giants hate heat. They can adapt to cold environments with effort, though, keeping their hearth fires burning bright and wearing heavy woolen clothing and furs to stay warm.\n\n_**Martial Experts.**_ From birth, a fire giant is taught to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents chant songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at war, hurling igneous rocks at one another across the banks of magma rivers. In later years, formal martial training becomes an integral part of life in the giants' fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash. The fire giants' songs are odes of battles lost and won, while their dances are martial formations of pounding feet that resound like smiths' hammers throughout their smoky halls.\n\nJust as fire giants pass down their knowledge of crafting from generation to generation, their renowned fighting prowess comes not from wild fury but from endless discipline and training. Enemies make the mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd tacticians.\n\n_**Feudal Lords.**_ Humanoids conquered in war become serfs to the fire giants. The serfs work the farms and fields on the outskirts of fire giant halls and fortresses, raising livestock and harvesting fields whose bounty is almost entirely tithed to the fire giant kings.\n\nFire giant crafters work through insight and experience rather than writing or arithmetic. Though most fire giants place little worth on such frivolousness, they sometimes keep serfs at court who are versed in such skills. Serfs not destined for court or the fields (especially dwarves) are taken to the fire giants' mountainous realms to mine ore and gemstones from deep within the earth.\n\nFire giants low in the ordning manage the mine tunnels and the serfs that toil there, few of which survive the difficult and dangerous work for long. Though fire giants are skilled in the engineering of mine tunnels and the gathering of ore, they place less importance on the safety of their serfs than on smelting and working the bounty those serfs produce.\n\n_**Skilled Artisans.**_ Fire giants have a fearsome reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their ability to burn, plunder, and destroy. Yet among the giants, fire giants produce the greatest crafters and artists. They excel at smelting and smith work, as they do at the engineering of metal and stone, and the quality of their artistry shows even in their implements of destruction and their weapons of war.\n\nFire giants strive to build the strongest fortresses and most potent siege weapons. They experiment with alloys to create the hardest armor, then forge the swords that can pierce it. Such work requires brawn and brains in equal measure, and fire giants high in the ordning tend to be the smartest and strongest of their kind.",

Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.\n\n_**Rulers by Might.**_ Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.\n\nWhen frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides.\n\n_**Make War, Not Goods.**_ Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's teeth or claws.",

    "long": "Gnolls are feral humanoids that attack settlements along the frontiers and borderlands of civilization without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh.\n\n_**Demonic Origin.**_ The origin of the gnolls traces back to a time when the demon lord Yeenoghu found his way to the Material Plane and ran amok. Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.\n\n_**Nomadic Destroyers.**_ Gnolls are dangerous because they strike at random. They emerge from the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed buildings, gnawed corpses, and befouled land. Gnolls choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.\n\nGnolls rarely build permanent structures or craft anything of lasting value. They don't make weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their patchwork armor.\n\n_**Thirst for Blood.**_ No goodness or compassion resides in the heart of a gnoll. Like a demon, it lacks anything resembling a conscience, and can't be taught or coerced to put aside its destructive tendencies. The gnolls' frenzied bloodlust makes them an enemy to all, and when they lack a common foe, they fight among themselves. Even the most savage orcs avoid allying with gnolls.",

Individually weak, goblins gather in large -- sometimes overwhelming -- numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.\n\n_**Goblinoids.**_ Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.\n\n_**Malicious Glee.**_ Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can't help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.\n\n_**Leaders and Followers.**_ Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.\n\n_**Challenging Lairs.**_ Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.\n\n_**Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders.**_ Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.\n\n_**Worshipers of Maglubiyet.**_ Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron. This is a \"privilege\" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.",

The oils of its body lubricate the armor. A sick or inactive gorgon gathers rust like fungus or mange. When a rusty gorgon moves, its plates squeal as they rub together.\n\n_**Monstrous Predator.**_ When a gorgon spots potential prey, it charges with a hideous clamor of metal on metal. When the gorgon hits, it pulverizes the foe and sends its sprawling, then tramples it to death with its cruel hooves. Faced with multiple foes, the gorgon exhales its deadly vapor to overcome the creatures it touches by turning them to stone.

The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.\n\nSince not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.\n\n_**Unwitting Servants.**_ Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.\n\n_**Spawn of Juiblex.**_ According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning.

Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.\n\nA green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.\n\nA wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.\n\nA green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.\n\n_**Capricious Hunters.**_ A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.\n\nGreen dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.\n\nA green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.\n\n_**Manipulative Schemers.**_ A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.\n\nWhen manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.\n\n_**Conflict and Corruption.**_ Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch -- sometimes for decades -- for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.\n\nGreen dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.\n\n_**Living Treasures.**_ A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards.

A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for other gricks.

Underdark explorers sometimes seal off the routes leading to and from a grick lair to starve them, then claim the wealth of the foul creatures' victims.",

When they attack, griffons are as swift and deadly as eagles, even as they strike with a lion's savage might and grace.\n\n_**Horse Eaters.**_ Griffons hunt in small prides, flying high over plains and forests near their rocky cliff-side aeries. Herd animals and horses are the prey they crave above all others, though they also hunt and kill hippogriffs. When it spots horses, a griffon screeches to alert its pride mates, which descend quickly toward their prey.\n\nThose riding or herding horses dread the griffon's piercing cry, preparing themselves for the bloody fight that inevitably follows. A griffon ignores a horse's rider when possible, and a rider that abandons its mount, or a herder that releases one or two horses, can escape unharmed while the griffon targets its chosen prey. Riders who attempt to protect their horses attract the full fury of an attacking griffon.\n\n_**Sky Dwellers.**_ Griffons lair in high rocky clifftop aeries, building their nests from sticks, leaves, and the bones of their prey. Once griffons establish a territory, they remain in that area until the food supply has been exhausted.\n\nAggressive and territorial, griffons engage in brutal aerial combat to defend their aeries, tearing and shredding the wings of flying intruders to send them spiraling to the ground. Creatures that climb to a griffon's lair are plucked from the cliffs and eaten, or are knocked from the heights to go tumbling to their deaths.\n\n_**Trained Mounts.**_ A griffon raised from an egg can be trained to serve as a mount. However, such training is time consuming, expensive (mostly for the ample food the creature requires), and dangerous. Expert trainers well versed in the griffon's legendary ferocity are typically the only ones able to raise these creatures safely.\n\nOnce trained, a griffon is a fierce and loyal steed. It bonds with one master for life, fighting to the death to protect that rider. A griffon mount retains its ravenous appetite for horseflesh, and a wise master ensures that a griffon remains satiated with other prey when passing through civilized lands.",

Among those were human cultures whose high priests the mind flayers subverted using their insidious powers of thought control. Those leaders gradually turned the faiths of their followers toward the illithids, which they worshiped as blasphemous deities.\n\nOver time, the rituals of these enslaved humans created fervent cannibal cults that regarded the brain eating of the mind flayers as a holy sacrament. The illithids commanded their worshipers to abduct other sentient creatures to be sacrificed. After the victims' brains had been consumed, the mind flayers gave the lifeless bodies to the cultists.\n\n_**Blind Hunters.**_ When the rule of the mind flayers crumbled, their cults faced constant warfare from their enemies, the same creatures that had once been their victims. The cults fled into the Underdark domains of their illithid gods. Over generations in that lightless realm, the cultists learned to rely on their other senses for survival. In time, their eyes withered away and eyelids sealed, leaving only covered eye sockets behind.\n\nA grimlock's ears prick up at the faintest footfall or whisper echoing down stone passageways. It can speak in tones too low for most other humanoids to hear. The odors of sweat, flesh, and blood awaken its hunger, and it can track by such scents like a bloodhound. To enhance their senses, grimlocks leave trails of blood, piles of dung, or the viscera of slain prey in places far from their lairs. When intruders pass through those areas, they carry the foul scents with them, warning the grimlocks of their approach.\n\nFor most creatures, blindness is an enormous hindrance. For a grimlock with its other heightened senses, sightlessness is a boon. A grimlock isn't fooled by visual illusions or misperceptions. It is fearless as it stalks prey.\n\n_**Endless War.**_ Grimlocks still venerate the mind flayers, serving them whenever possible. Grimlocks also recall the war in which they were driven underground. To them, it has never ended. They continue to return to the surface world to abduct captives for their illithid masters.",

A sphinx maintains its vigil tirelessly, not needing to sleep or eat. It rarely engages with others of its kind, knowing no other life except its sacred mission.\n\n_**Magical Tests**_. The secrets and treasures a sphinx guards remain under divine protection, so that when a creature fails a sphinx's test, the path to the object or knowledge it guards vanishes. Even if a sphinx is attacked and defeated, a quester will still fail to gain the secret it sought -- and will make an enemy of the god that placed the sphinx as a guardian.\n\nBenign deities sometimes grant a sphinx the power to remove supplicants that fail their tests, transporting them away and ensuring that they never encounter the sphinx again. However, those who fail a sphinx's test typically meet a gruesome end beneath its claws.\n\n_**Extraplanar Beings.**_ Mortals that encounter sphinxes do so most often in ancient tombs and ruins, but some sphinxes can access extraplanar realms. A conversation with a sphinx that begins between tumbled stone walls might suddenly shift to an alien locale, such as a life-sized game board or a daunting cliff that must be climbed in a howling storm. Sometimes a sphinx must be summoned from such an extradimensional space, with supplicants calling it from its empty lair. Only those the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm.\n\n_**Fallen Sphinxes.**_ Whether through the weariness of the ages, regret at the slaughter of innocents, or dreams of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to knowledge, some sphinxes break free of their divine command.

A creature might also transform into a half-dragon as a result of a mad wizard's spell or a ritual bath in dragon's blood. In all these cases, the result is a creature that combines the essence of a dragon with the form of its original race. Regardless of their origins, all half-dragons have similar features and appearance, gaining special senses, resistance to destructive energy, and a breath weapon.\n\n_**Draconic Nature.**_ Half-dragons are incapable of having natural born offspring. Those that wish to propagate must find other ways to do so, almost always involving magic. By way of compensation, half-dragons are blessed with long life. Barring unforeseen misfortune, a typical half-dragon's life expectancy is twice that of its nondraconic line, so that a half-dragon human might live more than a century and a half.\n\nHalf-dragons inherit personality traits common to their draconic heritage, so that half-gold dragons are often shy and secretive, while half-copper dragons are impish and playful. Half-green dragons are deceitful, while half-white dragons are often dim-witted brutes. These traits are tempered by a half-dragon's other lineage, but greed, arrogance, and paranoia are qualities that even good-aligned half-dragons often possess.\n\n**Half-Dragon Template**\n\nA beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon.

Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then consume.\n\nA harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a vulture with the torso, arms, and head of a human. Its wicked talons and bone club make it a formidable threat in combat, and its eyes reflect the absolute evil of its soul.\n\n_**Divine Curse.**_ Long ago, an elf wandering a forest heard birdsong so pure and wholesome that she was moved to tears. Following the music, she came upon a clearing where stood a handsome elf youth who had also paused to hear the bird's song. This was Fenmarel Mestarine, a reclusive elf god. His divine presence stole her heart as he fled, vanishing into the woods as if he was never there.\n\nThough the elf searched the woods and called for her stranger, she found no sign of his passage. Driven to despair by her longing, she begged the gods to help her. Aerdrie Faenya, elf goddess of the sky, heard the elf's cries and was moved to her aid. She appeared as the bird whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that song of beauty and seduction to the elf.\n\nWhen her singing failed to draw Fenmarel Mestarine to her side, the elf cursed the gods, invoking a dreadful power and transforming her into the first harpy. The curse worked its magic on the elf's spirit as well as her body, turning her desire for love into a hunger for flesh, even as her beautiful song continued to draw creatures to her deadly embrace.\n\n_**Harpy Song.**_ To hear a harpy's song is to hear music more beautiful than anything else in the world. A traveler that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward its source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy's wrath.\n\n_**Sadistic Cowards.**_ Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures. Harpies have no interest in a fair fight, and they never attack unless they have a clear advantage. If a fight turns against a harpy, it lacks the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than risk straight-up combat.\n\nWhen they attack, harpies play with their food, delighting in the \"music\" their victims make as they scream. A harpy takes its time dismembering a helpless foe and can spend days torturing a victim before the merciful end.\n\n_**Gruesome Collectors.**_ Harpies take shiny baubles, valuable objects, and other trophies from their victims, sometimes fighting with each other for the right to claim the choicest prizes. When no valuable objects can be found, a harpy takes hair, bones, or body parts to line its nest. A harpy's lair is usually hidden in remote ruins, where adventurers can discover valuable treasure and magic hidden beneath foul piles of offal.",

They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can, bullying smaller creatures into feeding them. Their laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their end if not for their formidable size and strength.\n\n_**Steadings.**_ Hill giants dwell in hills and mountain valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built of rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mud-and-wattle huts. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs.\n\n_**Bigger Means Better.**_ In a hill giant's world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power.\n\nHill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They know only that other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are to be obeyed. A hill giant tribe's chief is usually the biggest giant that can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a hill giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain the favor of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting the social order.\n\n_**Voracious Eaters.**_ With nothing else to occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn't obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud.\n\nFarmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the giant might snack on them too.\n\n_**Direct and Deadly.**_ Hill giants' ability to digest nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons without needing to adapt and change.\n\nWith no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They don't think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter.\n\nIn conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and they have little concept of deception. A hill giant might be fooled into running from another giant if a number of villagers cover themselves in blankets and stand on one another's shoulders holding a giant-painted pumpkin head. Reasoning with a hill giant is futile, although clever creatures can sometimes encourage a giant to take actions that benefit them.\n\n_**Raging Bullies.**_ A hill giant that feels as though it has been deceived, insulted, or made into a fool vents its terrible wrath on anything it encounters. Even after smashing those who offended it into pulp, the giant rampages until its rage abates, it notices something more interesting, or it grows hungry.\n\nIf a hill giant proclaims itself king over a territory where other humanoids live, it rules strictly by terror and tyranny. Its decisions shift with its mood, and if it forgets the title it bestowed upon itself, it might eat its subjects on a whim.",

Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.\n\nHobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.\n\n_**Military Legions.**_ Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.\n\nAs loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.\n\n_**Strategic Thinkers.**_ Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.\n\nLegions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.\n\n_**Beast Trainers.**_ Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.\n\n_**Conquer and Control.**_ Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.\n\nHobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.\n\nHobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistae.\n\n_**Legion of Maglubiyet.**_ Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron.",

A hydra rarely requires shelter from the elements, so it doesn't normally have a lair. Only in colder climes are hydras drawn to the protection of sheltered caverns and ruins.\n\nWhen a hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads remains awake and alert, making the creature difficult to catch by surprise.",

Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.\n\n_**Strength in Numbers.**_ Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be \"great wyrms\" more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together.

A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.\n\n_**The Lost God.**_ In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.\n\n_**Winged Kobolds**_. A few kobolds are born with leathery wings and can fly.

Its vicious black claws speak to its predatory nature, as does its hunger for torture and humanoid flesh.\n\n_**Tyrants of Pleasure.**_ Lamias adorn their crumbling havens with finery stolen from passing caravans, then use magic to further accentuate their lairs, masking decay with illusion. A lair's breathtaking gardens, finely decorated apartments, and numerous thralls seem at odds with its remoteness and state of ruin.\n\nUsing its intoxicating touch, a lamia weakens the minds of its enemies, making them more susceptible to its enchantment spells and turning them into its thralls. Those it beguiles with geas spells are pitted against each other in elaborate contests for the lamia's amusement.\n\n_**Vain Predators.**_ Always anxious to gain more wealth and thralls, a lamia uses a pool of water or a mirror in conjunction with a scrying spell to view its domain.

They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs interfere with their own. They hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.\n\nA lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.\n\n_**Secrets of Undeath.**_ No wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.\n\nA lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.\n\nWith its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation--a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.\n\n_**Soul Sacrifices.**_ A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the imprisonment spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a dispel magic cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.\n\nA lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.\n\n_**Death and Restoration.**_ When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.\n\nDestroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.\n\n_**Lonely Existence.**_ From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair.\n\nFew liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.\n\n_**Magic Collectors.**_ Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spellbooks, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.\n\n_**Undead Nature.**_ A lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Undead, constructs, and bound demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to disturb the lich's work.\n\nA lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000 XP).\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the lich can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- The lich rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.\n- The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich's lair.\n- The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear."

As a result, most live in small hunter-gatherer tribes, each of which holds unique values and creeds. Only occasionally do merfolk unite under the rule of a single leader.

They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.\n\n_**Animated Dead.**_ Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.\n\nWhile most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.\n\n_**Obedient Servants.**_ Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.\n\nA skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.\n\nAlthough they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.\n\n_**Habitual Behaviors.**_ Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.\n\nWhen skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.\n\n_**Undead Nature.**_ A skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes transgressors with the power of its unholy curse.\n\n_**Preserved Wrath**_. The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.\n\n_**The Will of Dark Gods.**_ An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.\n\n_**The Punished.**_ Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.\n\n_**Creature of Ritual.**_ A mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.\n\n_**Ending a Mummy's Curse.**_ Rare magic can undo or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.\n\nMore ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can't be so easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.\n\n_**Undead Archives.**_ Though they seldom bother to do so, mummies can speak.

Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.\n\n_**Ogre Gangs.**_ Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.\n\nWhenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants' complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.",

The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.\n\n_**Dark Servants.**_ Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator's bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.\n\nMost zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.\n\nA zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.\n\n_**Hideous Forms**_. Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.\n\n_**Mindless Soldiers.**_ Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.\n\nA zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.\n\n_**Undead Nature.**_ A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Their eyes are dark with strikingly white pupils, and their teeth and claws are jet black.\n\n_**Night Haunters.**_ By the light of day, an oni hides its true form with magic, gaining the trust of those it intends to betray when darkness descends. These creatures can change their size as well as their shape, appearing as humanoids as they pass through towns, pretending to be travelers, woodcutters, or frontier folk. In such a form, an oni takes stock of the selection of humanoids in a settlement and devises ways to abduct and devour some of them.\n\n_**Magical Ogres.**_ Oni are sometimes called ogre mages because of their innate magical ability.

    "long": "Orcs are burly raiders with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.\n\n_**Gruumsh One-Eye.**_ Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.\n\nOrcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.\n\n_**Tribes Like Plagues.**_ Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.\n\n_**Ranging Scavengers.**_ Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.\n\nWhen an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.\n\nOn rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.\n\n_**Leadership and Might.**_ Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.\n\nStrength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. They proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.\n\n_**Orc Progeny with Non-Orcs.**_ The offspring of an orc and a non-orc humanoid of similar stature is either an orc or a half-orc.

When an edible creature happens by, the otyugh's tentacles erupt from the filth and grab hold of it.\n\nOtyughs make the most of any opportunity to ambush and devour prey. They use a limited form of telepathy to urge sentient creatures toward their lairs, sometimes by pretending to be something else.\n\n_**Dwellers in Darkness.**_ Otyughs tolerate bright light only when considerable stores of carrion or garbage lie within reach. In the wilderness, they dwell in stagnant swamps, scum-filled ponds, and damp forest dells. The scent of graveyards, city sewers, village middens, and manure-filled animal pens attracts them to civilized areas.\n\nSince otyughs lack concern for anything but food, their nests sometimes accumulate a variety of treasures shed from their victims and mixed among the junk.\n\n_**Symbiotic Guardians.**_ Sentient subterranean beings can coexist with otyughs, employing them as garbage disposals. With such plentiful sustenance, otyughs grow fat in their wallows, unmoved by any other drive or desire. This sedentary gluttony makes them reliable guardians. As long as it is fed, an otyugh refrains from attacking other creatures. However, would-be otyugh masters can easily underestimate the quantity of waste, carrion, and meat necessary to keep an otyugh from wandering off in search of food.

Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.\n\n_**Deadly Ferocity.**_ The owlbear's reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness, and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.\n\n_**Consummate Predators.**_ An owlbear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes.\n\nAn owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.\n\nOwlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.\n\n_**Savage Companions.**_ Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owlbear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.\n\nElven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owlbears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.\n\n_**Owlbear Origins.**_ Scholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owlbears have always existed in the Feywild.",

The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.\n\n_**Fallen Angels.**_ An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast.\n\nFallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made.

They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.\n\n_**Obsessive Collectors.**_ Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.\n\nA red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.",

A pity there are so few foes and so little prey worthy of me.\n|    2 | The worship of smaller creatures pleases me, though their weakness is pathetic--how can they do other than adore me?\n|    3 | Nothing is better than to sleep and dream upon my hoard with the warmth of a full belly. Let those who would disturb me beware!\n|    4 | Ah, if these foolish creatures only knew they were but pawns in the games I play to amuse myself.\n|    5 | I know that others seek to steal my treasures, my beautiful baubles, won through strength and cunning. But they are mine. Mine!\n|    6 | All that I survey, I could easily destroy. From time to time, it is important to remind these small creatures of the true extent of my power.\n|    7 | Although my power and life span are vast, they have merely whetted my appetite for immortality.\n|    8 | Heroes need foes to test them. Not all teachers can afford to be kind, and some lessons must be harsh.\n```\n\n**Red Dragon Ideals**\n\n```\n|   d6 | Ideal\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | Cruelty. Pain and fear are the most powerful tools. With them, any creature's will can be broken. (Evil)\n|    2 | Might. Only the strongest survive and prosper, so I must be the strongest of all. (Any)\n|    3 | Greed. If I desire a thing, then it must be mine and mine alone. (Evil)\n|    4 | Respect. All that I have achieved must be acknowledged and treated with the utmost respect. (Any)\n|    5 | No Limits. I do whatever I please, whenever it pleases me to do so. (Chaotic)\n|    6 | Responsibility. Fire destroys, but it can also temper when it is applied carefully--if the material tested is strong enough. (Lawful)\n```\n\n**Red Dragon Adventures**\n\nThe Red Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for stories and adventures involving red dragons.\n\n**Red Dragon Adventure Hooks**\n\n```\n|   d8 | Adventure Hook\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | A red dragon has spent years hunting a stolen treasure, which has fallen into the hands of adventurers who have no idea where it came from.\n|    2 | A red dragon's fiery breath is the only means of completing an important magic item or of destroying a baleful artifact.\n|    3 | A red dragon is the cause of raging wildfires, making the hunt for the dragon even more dangerous.\n|    4 | A red dragon is unusually willing to entertain a peace envoy representing the various peoples dwelling in the valley below the dragon's mountain lair.\n|    5 | A dwarf wants to recover a family heirloom rumored to be in the hoard of a red dragon.\n|    6 | Evil cultists plan to meet with a red dragon and persuade it to become a dracolich.\n|    7 | A red dragon has been held in an enchanted slumber for generations, but signs suggest the enchantment is beginning to fail.\n|    8 | A region has survived for generations by annually tithing victims and treasures to a red dragon.\n```\n\n**Connected Creatures**\n\nRed dragons treat other creatures as potential servants or pawns, valuable only as long as they fulfill the dragon's needs. Many red dragons terrorize creatures into serving them--and sometimes into worshiping them as well. Others build up shadowy networks of manipulation and control, so many of their servants have no idea who the true ruler is.\n\n**Red Dragon Wyrmling Connections**\n\n```\n|   d6 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | A fire giant lord has captured a red dragon wyrmling and is looking to train the willful creature as a pet.\n|    2 | A red dragon wyrmling adopted a nest of fire snakes, which have now grown into salamanders who protect the wyrmling.\n|    3 | A band of kobolds was driven out of its warren by a red dragon wyrmling; they now raid to survive--and to gather offerings to propitiate \"the winged god.\"\n|    4 | A tiefling child has secretly hidden and raised a red dragon wyrmling from an egg. The wyrmling is bonded to the child, but dangerous to anyone else.\n|    5 | A bound fire elemental serves as the guardian of an orphaned red dragon wyrmling.\n|    6 | A band of hobgoblins is thrown into chaos when a red dragon wyrmling supports a coup by an ambitious war leader, in exchange for tribute.\n```",

When the war ended, the rocs were freed from giant domination and spread throughout the world.\n\nThough cloud giants and storm giants sometimes tame these great birds, rocs treat even giants as potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small creatures, and it ignores towns and forests where prey can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow-moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a roc dives down to snatch its prey in its massive talons.\n\n_**Remote and Alone.**_ Rocs are solitary creatures that can live for centuries. They lair in nests made from trees, tents, broken ships, and the remains of caravans they carry off, placing these massive tangles in mountain clefts out of the reach of lesser creatures.\n\nSometimes a roc's nest contains treasures from the caravans or ships they raid, but these creatures are heedless of such baubles.

The creature can move slowly using thousands of sticky cilia beneath its base.

A roper can hold still for long hours, shutting its single eye to look like nothing more than a mundane formation of rock. Creatures that come too close are surprised when that eye snaps open and sticky tendrils shoot out to seize them.

A roper's digestive juices are also valuable, fetching a high price from alchemists who use them as a solvent.\n\n_**Weakening Tendrils.**_ A roper has six nubs set along its body, through which it extrudes sticky tendrils that bond to whatever they touch. Each tendril sends out hair-like growths that penetrate a creature's flesh and sap its strength, so the victim can struggle only weakly as the roper reels it in.

Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as \"sea devils,\" for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.\n\n_**Devils of the Deep.**_ Sahuagin are a predatory, piscine race that ventures from the ocean's black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore. Though they dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean, sahuagin view the entire aquatic realm as their kingdom and the creatures in it as blood sport for their hunting parties.\n\nThe self-styled rulers of sahuagin ocean domains are massive mutant males that grow second sets of arms. They are terrible foes in battle, and all sahuagin bow down before these powerful barons.\n\n_**Way of the Shark.**_ Sahuagin worship the shark god Sekolah. Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the god's power, and priestesses hold tremendous sway in sahuagin communities.\n\nSahuagin are driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh blood. As worshipers of Sekolah, they also have a special kinship with sharks, which they train as attack animals. Even untrained sharks recognize sahuagin as allies and don't prey on them.\n\n_**Elven Enmity.**_ The sahuagin might control the oceans if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the aquatic elves. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict.\n\nSo intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti -- a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way. Sahuagin are prone to mutation, but whether this rare phenomenon is a result of the wars between the sahuagin and the aquatic elves -- or whether it preceded or even began the conflict -- none can say.\n\nThe sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities and the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin.

Outside their home plane, they play among the burning skeletons of charred trees as forest fires rage around them, or slither down the slopes of erupting volcanoes to linger in fire pits and magma floes.\n\n_**Fire Snakes.**_ Salamanders hatch from eggs that are two-foot-diameter spheres of smoldering obsidian. When a salamander is ready to hatch, it melts its way through the egg's thick shell and emerges as a fire snake. A fire snake matures into a salamander adult within a year.\n\n_**Enslaved by the Efreet.**_ Long ago, the efreet hired azers to build the fabled City of Brass, but then failed in their attempt to enslave that mystical race when the azers' work was done. Turning instead to strike against salamanders, the efreet conquered and enslaved them, then sent them out to unleash war and destruction across the planes.\n\nSalamanders despise the azers, believing that if the efreet had succeeded in dominating that race of elemental crafters, the salamanders would still be free. The efreet use this enmity to their own advantage, stoking the salamanders' hatred and pitting them against the efreet's former servants.\n\nThe efreet suffer salamanders to serve no other master; when efreet encounter salamanders dedicated to the cults of Elemental Evil, they slay them rather than enslaving them.\n\n_**Domineering Nobles.**_ Although salamanders follow the destructive impulses of their fiery nature, slavery under the efreet has impacted the culture of free salamanders. They rule their own societies according to the efreet model, in which larger and stronger salamanders claim dominion over their lesser kin.\n\nAs salamanders age, they increase in size and status, rising to positions of power as cruel nobles among their kind. Nobles rule wandering bands of salamanders, which move across the Elemental Plane of Fire like desert nomads, raiding other communities for treasure.\n\n_**Living Forges.**_ Salamanders generate intense heat, and when they fight, their weapons glow red and sear the bodies of their enemies on contact.

Only the shambling mounds' rarity and plodding speed prevent them from overwhelming entire ecosystems. Even so, their presence leeches natural environments of plant and animal life, and an unsettling quiet pervades the swamps and woods haunted by these ever-hungry horrors.\n\n_**Unseen Hunters.**_ Composed of decaying leaves, vines, roots, and other natural swamp and forest compost, shamblers can blend into their environs. Because they move slowly, they rarely attempt to pursue and catch creatures. Rather, they remain in place, sustaining themselves by absorbing nutrients from their surroundings as they wait for prey to come to them. When a creature passes near or alights upon a shambling mound, the monster comes to life, seizing and absorbing the unwary prey.\n\n_**Spawned by Lightning.**_ A shambling mound results from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey magic invigorates an otherwise ordinary swamp plant. As the plant is reborn into its second life, it chokes the life from plants and animals around it, mulching their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those roots eventually give up their reliance on the soil, directing the shambling mound to seek out new sources of food.\n\n_**The Weed that Walks.**_ The instinct that drives a shambling mound is its central root-stem, buried somewhere inside its ponderous form. The rest of a shambler consists of the rotting heap that it simultaneously accumulates and feeds on, which protects the root-stem and animates to smash and smother the life from any creature.\n\nThe dense mass of a shambling mound's body shrugs off the effects of cold and fire. Lightning reinvigorates the root-stem, strengthening the shambling mound and bolstering its consumptive drive.\n\nDespite its monstrous form, the shambling mound is a living plant that requires air and nourishment. Although it doesn't sleep the way an animal does, it can lie dormant for days on end before rising to hunt for food.\n\n_**A Resurgent Menace.**_ If a shambling mound faces defeat before an overwhelming foe, the root-stem can feign death, collapsing the remains of its mound. If not subsequently killed, the root-stem beds down in the shambler's remains to slowly regrow its full body, then once again sets out to consume all it can.

Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.\n\n_**Respect for Humanity.**_ Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.\n\n_**Hoarding History.**_ Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.",

    "long": "Skeletons arise when animated by dark magic. They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.\n\n_**Animated Dead.**_ Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.\n\nWhile most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.\n\n_**Obedient Servants.**_ Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.\n\nA skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.\n\nAlthough they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.\n\n_**Habitual Behaviors.**_ Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.\n\nWhen skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.\n\n_**Undead Nature.**_ A skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

On the battlefield, the solar's sword flies into the fray on its own, and a single arrow from a solar's bow can strike a target dead on contact. So great is a solar's celestial might that even demon princes shrink at its resonant commands.\n\nIt is said that only twenty-four solars exist. The few solars that are known are stewards of specific deities. The others rest in a state of contemplation, waiting for the time when their services are needed to stave off some cosmic threat to the cause of good.\n\n---\n\n**Angels**\n\nAn angel is a celestial agent sent forth into the planes to further its god's agenda for weal or woe. Its sublime beauty and presence can drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are destroyers too, and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.\n\n_**Shards of the Divine.**_ Angels are formed from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of great power and foresight.\n\nAngels act out the will of their gods with tireless devotion. Even chaotic good deities command lawful good angels, knowing that the angels' dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands. An angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity. However, an angel is incapable of following commands that stray from the path of law and good.\n\nAn angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.\n\n_**Fallen Angels.**_ An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast.\n\nFallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and compassionate service.\n\n_**Immortal Nature.**_ An angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.",

Specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever.

No such rest or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.\n\n_**Undying Hatred.**_ Living creatures remind the specter that life is beyond its grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.\n\n_**Dwellers in Darkness.**_ Sunlight represents a source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their final resting places in search of living creatures to slay, knowing that few weapons can harm them in return. At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the darkness, where they remain until night falls again.\n\n_**Undead Nature.**_ A specter doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Interlopers that come too close have their moral character judged, then are put to sleep or frightened off.\n\n_**Forest Protectors.**_ Sprites build little villages in the boughs of trees and willing treants, in verdant glades brightened by moss, wild flowers, and toadstools. Wild nature thrives, and the sprites allow no trespassers. When intruders are spotted, the sprites lead them astray with ominous rustling from the bushes and distant snapping twigs. Creatures foolish enough to persist in intruding on a sprite's territory are stung with poisoned arrows and lulled into a senseless sleep. While they slumber, the sprites make good their escape, retreating to an even more secluded area of the forest.\n\n_**Heart Seers.**_ Sprites can sense whether a creature is good or evil by the sound and feeling of its beating heart. Weighing the balance of a creature's past actions, a sprite can tell whether its heart beats rapidly in love or flags in sorrow, or whether it is darkened by hate or greed. The sprite's power to perceive the heart always shows the truth, because the heart can't lie.\n\n_**Poison Brewers.**_ In their forest domains, sprites brew toxins, unguents, antidotes, and poisons, including the sleep poison with which they coat their arrows. They venture far into the woods to harvest rare flowers, mosses, and fungi, sometimes crossing dangerous territory to do so. If desperate, sprites even steal their ingredients from the gardens of hags.\n\n_**Good-Hearted.**_ Because they are judges of the heart and favor good creatures, sprites oppose the will of evil fey and pledge to thwart evil archfey at every turn.

Cavern networks are their towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground streams their waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.\n\nIn their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly chip away at elaborate carvings, measuring time in the echoing drip of water into cavern pools. In the deepest chambers of a stone giant settlement, far from the chittering of bats or the patrols paced out by the giants' cave bear companions, are holy places where silence and darkness are complete. Stone takes on its most sacred quality in these cavern cathedrals, their buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that shames the legendary stonecraft of the dwarves.\n\n_**Carvers and Seers.**_ Among stone giants, artistry ranks as the greatest virtue. They create intricate murals, paint sprawling murals across cavern walls, and indulge in a wide variety of other artistic disciplines. They esteem stone carving as the greatest of skills.\n\nStone giants strive to draw shapes out of raw stone, which they believe reveal meaning inspired by their god, Skoraeus Stonebones. The giants appoint the tribe's best carvers as their leaders, shamans, and prophets. The holy hands of such giants become the hands of the god as they work.\n\n_**Graceful Athletes.**_ Despite their great size and musculature, stone giants are lithe and graceful. Skilled rock throwers are granted positions of high rank in the giants' ordning, testing and demonstrating their ability to hurl and catch enormous boulders. Such giants take the front ranks when a tribe has cause to defend its home or attack its enemies. However, even in combat, artistry is key. A stone giant hurling a rock performs not just a feat of brute strength but also one of stunning athleticism and poise.\n\n_**Dreamers under Sky.**_ Stone giants view the world outside their underground homes as a realm of dreams where nothing is entirely true or real. They behave in the surface world the way humanoids might behave in their own dreams, making little account for their actions and never fully trusting what they see or hear. A promise made above ground need not be kept. Insults can be made without apology. Killing prey or sentient beings is no cause for guilt in the dreaming world beneath the sky.\n\nStone giants lacking in athletic grace or artistic skill dwell at the fringes of their society, serving as the tribe's outlying guardians and far-wandering hunters.

Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.\n\nThough legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.\n\n_**Beautiful Corrupters.**_ A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.\n\nInevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.\n\nA mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely -- some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed -- the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.\n\nThe succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul.\n\n_**Deadly Kiss.**_ The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.\n\n_**Fiendish Offspring.**_ Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.",

It carries itself like a bird of prey, leaning forward and using its powerful lashing tail for balance. Its cavernous maw yawns wide enough to swallow all but the largest creatures, and so great is its hunger that it can devour the populations of whole towns.\n\n_**Legendary Destruction.**_ The destructive potential of the tarrasque is so vast that some cultures incorporate the monster into religious doctrine, weaving its sporadic appearance into stories of divine judgment and wrath. Legends tell how the tarrasque slumbers in its secret lair beneath the earth, remaining in a dormant state for decades or centuries. When it awakens in answer to some inscrutable cosmic call, it rises from the depths to obliterate everything in its path.",

Although treants prefer to while away the days, months, and years in quiet contemplation, they fiercely protect their woodland demesnes from outside threats.\n\n_**The Sleeping Tree Awakens.**_ A tree destined to become a treant meditates through a long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before realizing its potential. Trees that awaken do so only under special circumstances and in places steeped with nature's magic. Treants and powerful druids can sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in secret groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the long process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a division of the lower trunk into legs, and long branches bending downward to serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.\n\n_**Legendary Guardians.**_ After a treant awakens, it continues to grow exactly as it did when it was a tree. Treants created from the mightiest trees can reach great sizes while developing an innate magical power over plants and animals. Such treants can animate plants, using them to ensnare and trap intruders. They can call wild creatures to aid them or carry messages across great distances.\n\n_**Protectors of the Wild.**_ Even after awakening, a treant spends much of its time living as a tree. While rooted in place, a treant remains aware of its surroundings, and can perceive the effects of events taking place miles away based on subtle changes nearby.\n\nWoodcutters who avoid culling healthy living trees and hunters who take only what they need of the forest's bounty are unlikely to arouse a treant's ire.

Unrelated to the horses it resembles, a unicorn is a celestial creature that wanders sylvan realms, its white form glimmering like starlight.\n\nA unicorn's brow sports a single spiraling horn of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and the injured. Its ears catch the words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows the tongues of elves and sylvan folk. Unicorns allow good-hearted creatures to enter their woods to hunt or gather food, but they hold evil ever at bay. Foul-hearted creatures seldom leave a unicorn's domain alive.\n\n_**Divine Guardians.**_ Good deities placed unicorns on the Material Plane to ward away evil and preserve and protect sacred places. Most unicorns protect a bounded realm such as an enchanted forest. However, the gods sometimes send a unicorn to guard sacred artifacts or protect specific creatures. When the forces of darkness strike against an individual the gods wish to protect, they might send that individual to a unicorn's forest, where evil creatures pursue at their peril.\n\nUnicorns most often serve deities of the forest and woodlands, including the gods of benevolent fey. Although all unicorns have natural healing power, some serve the gods in greater capacities, performing miracles normally reserved for high priests.\n\n_**Forest Lords.**_ A unicorn's forest is a celestial realm where nothing that occurs beneath the sun-dappled leaves escapes the creature's notice. A unicorn hears each breathy tune sung by the elves that reside amid the treetops. It senses where every caterpillar spins its cocoon, each leaf and branch upon which a bright butterfly rests its tired wings.\n\nIn a unicorn's forest, a sense of calm pervades. From wolves and foxes to birds, squirrels, and tiny insects, the creatures of a unicorn's domain seem quite tame. Pixies, sprites, satyrs, dryads, and other normally mercurial fey loyally serve a unicorn when they dwell within its woods. Under a unicorn's protection, creatures feel safe from the threat of encroaching civilization and the insidious spread of evil.\n\nA unicorn roams its domain constantly, moving ever so carefully so as not to disturb other denizens. A creature might catch a passing glimpse of the unicorn then suddenly see nothing but the wild woods.\n\n_**Sacred Horns.**_ A unicorn's horn is the focus of its power, a shard of divine magic wrought in spiraling ivory. Wands of unicorn horn channel powerful magic, while unicorn horn weapons strike with divine force. Wizards can work powdered unicorn horn into potent potions and scroll ink, or use it as a component in eldritch rituals. However, any creature that takes a role, no matter how small, in slaying a unicorn is likely to become the target of divine retribution.\n\n_**Blessed Mounts.**_ When darkness and evil threaten to overwhelm the mortal world, the gods sometimes see fit to pair a unicorn mount with a champion. A paladin astride a unicorn is a sign of the gods' direct intervention in the affairs of the mortal realm. It is a holy alliance made to cleave the heads from demons and banish devils back to the Nine Hells.\n\nAs long as the troubled times of darkness persist, the unicorn stays by the champion, its horn shining brightly to drive back the night. However, if the gods' champion falls from grace or turns from the cause of righteousness and good, the unicorn departs, never to return.",

This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life.

Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.\n\nA skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.\n\nAlthough they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless.

The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat.

Though most werebears are of good alignment, some are every bit as evil as other lycanthropes.\n\nOne of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast.

    "characteristics": null,
    "long": "The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.\n\nA white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.\n\n_**Primal and Vengeful.**_ White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.\n\nA white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.\n\nThough only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.\n\n_**Lone Masters.**_ White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.\n\nWhite dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.\n\nPowerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.\n\n_**Treasure Under Ice.**_ White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.\n\nLoose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.\n\nA white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.",

It is my sole companion.\n|    7 | I meet any challenge to my territory with aggression, even if I can't win outright.\n|    8 | I feel protective of smaller, weaker creatures that are tormented by larger monsters.\n```\n\n**White Dragon Ideals**\n\n```\n|   d6 | Ideal\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | Rapacity. When a creature has the misfortune of crossing my path, I ask myself two questions: Am I hungry now? And if not, will I be hungry later? (Any)\n|    2 | Survival. This world is harsh and unforgiving, and so am I. I do whatever it takes to survive. (Any)\n|    3 | Dominance. I delight in making others tremble, knowing that I could kill them at any time. (Evil)\n|    4 | Isolation. All creatures are either prey or rivals. What do you mean by \"company?\" (Any)\n|    5 | Vengeance. Every scar upon my scales, every treasure beyond my reach, is a slight that must be answered. (Evil)\n|    6 | Service. I used to live as a beast, before learning what is possible when creatures put aside their petty needs in service of a greater goal.

Now the ice is melting and the demon will soon awaken--so the dragon must be lured back.\n|    6 | A white dragon has been raiding distant farmlands, procuring gifts of food for a mate with a taste for unusual cuisine.\n|    7 | A white dragon has been exacting vengeance on a rival silver dragon by killing off the silver dragon's Humanoid companions.\n|    8 | A frost giant wants to subdue a white dragon, hoping to overthrow the current frost giant jarl with the dragon's aid. In exchange for assistance from adventurers, the giant promises peace between the giant clan and nearby settlements.\n```\n\n**Connected Creatures**\n\nSavage and territorial by nature, white dragons seldom set out to make alliances, though some come to understand the utility of doing so as they age. More often, white dragons encountered in the company of other creatures have been forced into an uneasy accommodation or a resentful servitude because they lack the power to dominate those companions outright.\n\n**White Dragon Wyrmling Connections**\n\n```\n|   d6 | Connected Creatures\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | A pair of ice mephits delight in chasing townsfolk into a white dragon wyrmling's lair to be eaten.\n|    2 | A brooding griffon found a dragon egg and cared for it along with her own brood. Though the white dragon wyrmling ate the griffon's other hatchlings, the griffon treats the wyrmling as her offspring and protects the creature fiercely.\n|    3 | A clan of warriors has adopted a white dragon wyrmling as the clan's sacred guardian and brings the wyrmling captured foes as offerings.\n|    4 | Yetis keep a white dragon wyrmling chained near the entrance of their lair to discourage scavengers.\n|    5 | A well-meaning druid is trying to rear a white dragon wyrmling as a guardian of nature, training the dragon to hunt only Monstrosities. But the wyrmling keeps attacking other creatures.\n|    6 | A band of ogres keeps a white dragon wyrmling caged near their larder, as they have discovered that the dragon's cold breath keeps their meat fresh.\n```",

Their appearance sends ripples of alarm through the borderlands of civilization.\n\nA wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.\n\n_**Aerial Hunters.**_ A wyvern doesn't fight on the ground unless it can't reach its prey by any other means, or if it has been fooled into a position from which aerial combat isn't an option. If forced into a confrontation on the ground, a wyvern crouches low, keeping its stinger poised above its head as it hisses and growls.\n\n_**Aggressive and Reckless.**_ A wyvern intent on its prey backs down only if it sustains serious injury, or if its prey eludes it long enough for another easier potential meal to wander along. If it corners a fleeing creature in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows.\n\nAlthough they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to their prey, with no thought given to possible ambushes.\n\n_**Tamed Wyverns.**_ A wyvern can be tamed for use as a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern's violent temperament has cost the life of many a would-be master.",

On the Material Plane, xorn must range far and wide through the Underdark to sustain themselves, becoming aggressive toward miners and treasure hunters when the valuable minerals of their diet are scarce.\n\nA xorn's unnatural origins are suggested by its unusually heavy body and the large, powerful mouth sitting atop its head. Its three long arms are each tipped with sharp talons, and its three large, stone-lidded eyes see in all directions.\n\n_**Elemental Travelers.**_ Possessed of the power of elemental earth, a xorn glides through stone and dirt as easily as a fish swims through water. It doesn't displace earth or stone when it moves, but merges with and flows through it, leaving no tunnel, hole, or hint of its passage.\n\nXorn prefer not to leave their home plane, where they easily eat their fill of gemstones and precious metals. When a xorn winds up on the Material Plane, whether by accident or from curiosity, it seeks sustenance and a way home.\n\n_**Beggars and Thieves.**_ Xorn scour the depths of the earth for precious metal and stones. Because they are unable to consume organic material, they ignore most other creatures. However, a xorn's ability to sniff out metals and stones often draws its attention to adventurers carrying coins and gems. Because a xorn isn't evil, it pleads or bargains in the hope of convincing owners to give up their treasure, offering up information it has learned from its travels in exchange. A xorn whose requests are ignored might resort to threats and bullying. If starving or angered, it resorts to force.",

These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.\n\nWith deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.\n\nWhen it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.\n\n_**Brutal and Cruel.**_ All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.\n\nA black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.\n\n_**Foes and Servants**_. Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.\n\nEvil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.\n\nA black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.\n\nKobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.",

These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.\n\nA blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.\n\nA blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.\n\n_**Vain and Deadly.**_ A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.\n\nA blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.\n\n_**Desert Predators.**_ Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.\n\nWhen it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.\n\n_**Overlords and Minions.**_ Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.\n\nA blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.\n\n_**Hoarders of Gems.**_ Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.\n\nA blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.",

A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age.

If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.\n\nA brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.\n\n_**Prized Treasures.**_ Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.\n\nBrass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs.

Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.\n\n_**Good Hosts.**_ A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.\n\nCopper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.\n\n_**Cautious and Crafty.**_ When building its hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.\n\nA copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions.

Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air.

Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.\n\n_**Reserved Shapeshifters.**_ Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.\n\nOlder gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways.

    "long": "The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.\n\nA green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.\n\nA wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.\n\nA green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.\n\n_**Capricious Hunters.**_ A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.\n\nGreen dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.\n\nA green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.\n\n_**Manipulative Schemers.**_ A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.\n\nWhen manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.\n\n_**Conflict and Corruption.**_ Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch -- sometimes for decades -- for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.\n\nGreen dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.\n\n_**Living Treasures.**_ A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.",

A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.\n\n_**Dragons of Virtue.**_ Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.\n\n_**Friends of the Small Races.**_ Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.\n\nSilver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.\n\n_**Respect for Humanity.**_ Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.\n\n_**Hoarding History.**_ Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.",

    "characteristics": null,
    "long": "The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.\n\nA white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.\n\n_**Primal and Vengeful.**_ White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.\n\nA white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.\n\nThough only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.\n\n_**Lone Masters.**_ White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.\n\nWhite dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.\n\nPowerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.\n\n_**Treasure Under Ice.**_ White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.\n\nLoose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.\n\nA white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.",

They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.\n\nMost zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.\n\nA zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.\n\n_**Hideous Forms.**_ Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.\n\n_**Mindless Soldiers.**_ Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.\n\nA zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.\n\n_**Undead Nature.**_ A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

A cyclops keeps its herd animals with it at night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to let it serve double duty as a barn.\n\nA cyclops lairs within a day's journey of other cyclopes, so that they can meet to trade goods or seek mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone, but will use metal when they can find it. Although cyclopes understand the Giant tongue, they write nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures for their interactions with each other.\n\nCyclopes don't use money for trade, but they value gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as jewelry.

Nothics retain no awareness of their former selves, skulking amid the shadows and haunting places rich in magical knowledge, drawn by memories and impulses they can't quite understand.\n\n_**Dark Oracles.**_ Nothics possess a strange magical insight that allows them to extract knowledge from other creatures. This grants them unique understanding of secret and forbidden lore, which they share for a price. A nothic covets magic items, greedily accepting such gifts from creatures that seek out its knowledge.\n\n_**Lurkers in Magical Places.**_ Nothics are notorious for infiltrating arcane academies and other places rich in magical learning. They are driven by the vague knowledge that there exists a method to reverse their condition. This isn't a clear sense of purpose, but rather an obsessive tug at the end of the mind. Some nothics are clever enough to realize that this is merely part of the strange lesson for their folly, a false hope to drive them to seek out more arcane secrets.",

    "monster_name": "Drow",
    "characteristics": null,
    "long": "Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the drow found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the drow built an empire in the underworld.\n\n_**Children of Lolth.**_ The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the drow have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do.\n\nDrow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.\n\n_**Creatures of Darkness.**_ The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When laborers are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.\n\n**_Underdark Cities._** The drow build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.\n\nA drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.\n\n_**Poison Predilection.**_ Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.\n\n_**Drow Magic.**_ Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.\n\n_**Arms and Armor.**_ Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.\n\n_**Cutthroat Politics.**_ Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.\n\nDrow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.\n\n_**Matriarchal Rule.**_ Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.\n\nIn drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow -- either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.",

An average adult weighs 100 to 120 pounds and stands 3 feet tall.\n\nA typical svirfneblin enclave contains several hundred deep gnomes and is strongly fortified. Secret tunnels lead to and from the settlement, and the deep gnomes use these as evacuation routes when the enclave comes under attack.\n\n**_Established Gender Roles._** Male svirfneblin are bald, while females have stringy gray hair. Traditionally, females run the enclaves while males scour the outskirts in search of enemies and deposits of precious gemstones.\n\n**_Gemstone Harvesters._** Svirfneblin cherish fine gemstones, especially rubies, which they harvest from mines deep in the Underdark. The hunt for gems often brings them into conflict with beholders, drow, kuo-toa, duergar, and mind flayers. Of all their natural enemies, deep gnomes fear and despise the murderous, demon-worshiping drow the most.\n\n_**Earth Friends.**_ Deep gnomes are often encountered in the company of creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth.

Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.\n\nThough legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.\n\n_**Beautiful Corrupters.**_ A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.\n\nInevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.\n\nA mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely -- some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed -- the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.\n\nThe succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul.\n\n_**Deadly Kiss.**_ The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.\n\n_**Fiendish Offspring.**_ Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.",

    "monster_name": "Puppeteer Parasite",
    "characteristics": "A puppeteer parasite looks like a rubbery amoeba the size of a dinner plate. Its dorsal surface is soft and glossy, while its ventral surface is lined with bony hooks. The parasite uses its hooks to attach to a wall or ceiling until suitable prey passes nearby.\n\nA parasite that comes in physical contact with a Humanoid uses its hooks to latch onto it. The parasite can then drain life energy from that creature or use it as transportation. The parasite can also impose its will on a nearby creature, forcing the creature to comply with its wishes. Puppeteer parasites like to use Humanoid thralls as bodyguards and transports.",

    "monster_name": "Eldritch Lich",
    "characteristics": "From beyond the stars, a Great Old One whispers promises of reality-defying knowledge and world-bending power. When a wizard or a warlock hears that whisper and listens too intently, they might set foot on the twisting path toward becoming an eldritch lich.\n\nLike other liches, eldritch liches are spellcasters who have cheated death, but an eldritch lich does so by allowing a Great Old One to implant a Far Realm parasite in the lich. That parasite bestows undeath upon the spellcaster and causes strange tentacles to sprout from the body. The parasite's mouth is visible on the lich's torso, and the parasite guards the lich against destruction, reviving the lich a few days after death. Canny foes can sabotage an eldritch lich's revival by slaying the lich in a magic circle, thereby forcing the lich to return in a distorted form, robbed of most of its power.\n\nAn eldritch lich constantly hears bizarre whispers from the Far Realm, to which the lich nods and mutters. Occasionally, the lich uses its telepathy to share those whispers with the minds around it.\n\n**Form of the Great Old One**\n\nMultiple entities bear the title Great Old One. You may roll on the Great Old Ones table to determine which entity gave an eldritch lich its parasite.\n\n**Great Old Ones**\n\n```\n|   d6 | Form\n|------+---------------\n|    1 | Cthulhu\n|    2 | Tharizdun, the Chained God\n|    3 | Dendar, the Night Serpent\n|    4 | Ghaunadaur\n|    5 | Zargon, the Returner\n|    6 | That Which Lurks\n```",

    "monster_name": "Fractine",
    "characteristics": "A fractine is a bizarre, two-dimensional creature that flies through Wildspace and the Astral Sea, folding and refolding like a piece of origami. When it encounters another creature, it flattens into a plane that resembles a trapezoidal mirror between 9 and 13 feet tall.\n\nAstral explorers who have encountered fractines attest that the creatures are intelligent and often allow themselves to be used as scrying sensors, their reflective surfaces substituting for the mirror needed to cast certain divination spells. While being used in this way, the fractine siphons magical energy from the spellcaster--not enough to cause harm, but enough to make the caster take notice.\n\nA fractine needs light and magical energy to survive. It can draw sustenance from a nearby light source, spellcaster, magic item, or magical effect without causing harm to anyone or anything. A fractine that doesn't consume light or magical energy for ten days begins to flicker. A day later, it folds in on itself and self-destructs, leaving no trace of itself behind. The destruction of a fractine is accompanied by a loud sound reminiscent of shattering glass.\n\nA fractine attacks by falling on its targets, dealing damage as it passes through them. A fractine can also imprison a creature inside a demiplane contained within its two-dimensional form, the prisoner's distorted reflection visible in the fractine's glassy surface.\n\nBludgeoning, piercing, slashing, and thunder damage can cause a fractine to break into two smaller fractines, each one autonomous and capable of imprisoning creatures. When a fractine dies, it folds in on itself and disappears, releasing any creature trapped inside it.",

    "characteristics": "Gadabouts are gentle, winged creatures that can be used as personal conveyances for short-distance travel across the airless void of Wildspace. A gadabout wraps its branches around a Humanoid creature, spreads its butterfly wings, and allows its wearer to fly through space in a continuously refreshed air envelope. The gadabout's leaves even provide a nourishing syrup that its wearer can consume in the absence of other food and water. One Humanoid can survive on these leaves for up to sixty days.\n\nGadabouts require sunlight and water to survive. A healthy specimen can live for 25 years. Although its preferred mode of travel is flight, a gadabout can creep slowly along the ground as well.\n\nElves are the only Humanoids to date who know how to grow gadabouts. Since gadabouts don't generate seeds, each one is a valuable commodity. Mercane and dohwar merchants who come into possession of a healthy gadabout might sell it for 2,500 gp or more.",

Unblinking eyes on the outer surface of its spherical air sac enable the creature to see in all directions at once. These eyes can produce kaleidoscopic light that tears at the minds of the goon balloon's foes.\n\nA goon balloon speaks by pumping air through a hidden orifice on its underside. When the goon balloon dies, the air in its sac transforms into a noxious gas that bursts from the corpse, potentially poisoning other creatures nearby.\n\nAlthough they can seem playful and harmless, goon balloons are quite mean-spirited. They like to observe the suffering of other creatures and orchestrate that suffering, given half a chance.",

Its skin is thick and tough, and its teeth are long and sharp. A pair of long, curved tusks jut from the sides of the beast's mouth, and its large red eyes glow in the dark. The creature smashes through structures and fortifications with ease, and it doesn't hesitate to rend foes with its claws and gore them with its tusks, but its most devastating attack is its magical ability to disintegrate foes with its terrible gaze.\n\nPowerful spellcasters create nightmare beasts to serve as living siege engines. A single beast can lay waste to entire cities and armies.",
